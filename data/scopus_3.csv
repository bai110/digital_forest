Here, multispectral optical imagery was used for retrieving biophysical variables through the inversion of a 3-D radiative transfer model. Two inversion procedures are presented: a classical procedure for high resolution imagery and an innovative procedure specifically designed for very high resolution imagery (resolution around 1 m). They were tested with SPOT ('Satellite Pour l'Observation de la Terre') and Ikonos images, respectively. One of the objectives was to assess to which extent the inversion of high and very high resolution satellite imagery can help in assessing how Fontainebleau forest (France) was damaged by a very strong storm on December 1999. Retrieved biophysical variables are: Leaf Area Index (LAI), Crown Coverage (CC) and leaf chlorophyll concentration (Cab). Compared with ground measurements, SPOT-derived LAI has a root mean square error (RMSE) of around 1.4 at stand scale. This is not accurate enough to quantify the effects of the storm. However, LAI variation was assessed at a forest scale. On the other hand, the innovative procedure applied to Ikonos data led to more accurate results. For example, the relative error between estimated and ground measured LAI was improved, on average, from 23% (using 20 m resolution imagery) to 6% (using very high resolution imagery). © 2004 Taylor &amp; Francis Ltd.",,"Carbon; Chlorophyll; Concentration (process); Forestry; Image analysis; Satellites; Storms; Vegetation; Biosphere; Carbon cycle; High resolution imagery; Multispectral optical imagery; Image sensors; biosphere; imagery; radiative transfer; remote sensing; three-dimensional modeling; vegetation; Carbon; Chlorophylls; Concentration; Forestry; Image Analysis; Plants; Satellites; Sensors",,,,,,,,,,,,"Gascon, F.; European Space Agency (ESA), Kerplerlaan 1, 2200 AZ Noordwijk ZH, Netherlands; email: ferran.gascon@esa.int",,"Taylor and Francis Ltd.",01431161,,IJSED,,"English","Int.

Ct., Suite 300, Ann A., United States","A new database of fire activity in Russia derived from 1-km resolution remote sensing imagery is presented and discussed. The procedure used to generate this burned-area product is described, including active-fire detection and burn-scar mapping approaches. Fire detection makes use of a probabilistic procedure using image data from the United States National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA) advanced very high resolution radiometer (AVHRR) system. Using the combination of AVHRR data collected at the Krasnoyarsk, Russia, high-resolution picture transmission (HRPT) receiving station, and data from the NOAA Satellite Active Archive (SAA), fire maps are being created for all of Russia for 1995 to 1997 and all of Eastern Russia (east of the Ural Mountains) for 1995 to 2002. This mapping effort has resulted in the most complete set of historic fire maps available for Russia. An initial validation indicates that the burned-area estimates are conservative because the approaches do not detect smaller fires, and, in many cases, fire areas are slightly underestimated. Analyses using the fire database showed that an average of 7.7×106 ha yr-1 of fire occurred in Eastern Russia between 1996 and 2002 and that fire was widely dispersed in different regions. The satellite-based burned-area estimates area were two to five times greater than those contained in official government burned-area statistics. The data show that there is significant interannual variability in area burned, ranging between a low of 1.5×106 ha in 1997 to a high of 12.1×106 ha in 2002. Seasonal patterns of fire are similar to patterns seen in the North American boreal region, with large-fire seasons experiencing more late-season burning (in August and September) than during low-fire years. There was a distinct zonal distribution of fires in Russia; 65% of the area burned occurred in the taiga zone, which includes southern, middle, and northern taiga subzones, 20% in the steppe and forest steppe zones, 12% in the mixed forest zone, and 3% in the tundra and forest-tundra zones. Lands classified as forest experienced 55% of all burned area, while crops and pastures, swamps and bogs, and grass and shrubs land cover categories experienced 13% to 15% each. Finally, the utility of the products is discussed in the context of fire management and carbon cycling. © 2004 Elsevier Inc.

This was achieved by comparing aerial photographs with data obtained previously from destructive sampling in the same area. Aerial photographs were taken above the primary and logged forest plots in 1997. The heights of the canopy-forming trees were estimated in both plots by means of aerial triangulation and were regressed against the diameter at breast height (DBH) of the corresponding trees measured during ground surveys. The resulting allometric relationship between tree height and DBH let us estimate TAGB: in the primary forest, TAGB was 310 Mg ha -1, which was ca. 10-12% smaller than the value estimated by means of destructive sampling conducted in the 1970s. The estimated TAGB of the logged forest was 274 Mg ha -1, which was significantly smaller than that of the primary forest (P &lt; 0.05). We also measured canopy surface height in a 2.5 m grid system. We found that the mean canopy surface height (MCH) in every 20 m × 20 m subplot (0.04 ha) was significantly (P &lt; 0.0001) correlated with TAGB for that subplot. This suggests that the spatial variation of TAGB can be estimated using MCH values obtained from such a grid system, and that biomass levels can potentially be estimated by means of satellite remote sensing on larger scales, even for very dense tropical forests. We also found that digital reflectance values from Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) images differed significantly between the logged and primary forests, and hypothesize that these differences relate to structural differences in the canopy surface. However, TAGB in both plots was poorly correlated with the Landsat reflectance values, suggesting the necessity of using an active remote-sensing sensor or a laser profiling system that can quantify changes in the forest's vertical structure or volume to estimate biomass and its variation in dense evergreen forests. © 2004 Elsevier B.V.

Net ecosystem exchange (NEE) of CO2 was measured using aircraft and ground flux techniques and was linearly related to absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (APAR). The slope of this relationship is the radiation use efficiency (ε = 0.51 g C/MJ APAR); there were no significant differences in the regression coefficients between the two sites. Furthermore, ecosystem chamber measurements of total respiration in 1998 and 1999 were used to develop a functional relationship with daily average temperature; the Q10 of the relationship was 2.2. Using the Advanced Very High Resolution radiometer. Normalized Difference Vegetation Index and meteorological data, annual gross primary production and respiration were calculated from 1995 to 1999 for the two sites. Overall, the sagebrush-steppe site was a net carbon sink, whereas the northern mixed-grass prairie site was in carbon balance. There was no significant relationship between NEE and APAR for a coniferous forest site, indicating this method for scaling up CO2 flux data may be only applicable to rangeland ecosystems. The combination of remote sensing with data from CO2 flux networks can be used to estimate carbon sequestration regionally in rangeland ecosystems. © 2004 Springer-Verlag New York, LLC.","NDVI: Absorbed photosynthetically active radiation; Net ecosystem exchange; Northern mixed-grass prairie; Radiation use efficiency; Sagebrush-steppe","Carbon; Chelation; Data reduction; Ecosystems; Photosynthesis; Regression analysis; Remote sensing; Carbon sequesteration; NDVI: Adsorbed photosynthetically active radiation; Net ecosystem exchange; Northern mixed-grass praire; Radiation use efficiency; Sagebrush steppe; Agronomy; carbon dioxide; carbon budget; carbon sequestration; prairie; remote sensing; aircraft; article; carbon sequestration; conifer; ecosystem; forest; gas exchange; meteorological phenomena; primary production (biomass); radiometry; regression analysis; remote sensing; scale up; vegetation; Agronomy; Carbon; Chelation; Data Recorders; Ecosystems; Photosynthesis; Regression Analysis; Remote Sensing; Artemisia tridentata; Coniferophyta",,,,,,,,,,,,"Hunt Jr., E.R.; Hydrology and Remote Sensing Laboratory, 10300 Baltimore Avenue, Beltsville, MD 20705-2350, United States; email: erhunt@hydrolab.arsusda.gov",,,0364152X,,EMNGD,,"English","Environ.

National governments have historically relied on forest inventories for assessments but developments in remote sensing technology provide additional opportunities for operational C monitoring. The estimate of total C stock in live forest biomass modeled from Landsat imagery for the St. Petersburg region was consistent with estimates derived from forest inventory data for the early 1990s (272 and 269 TgC, respectively). The estimates of mean C sink in live forest biomass also agreed well (0.36 and 0.34 Mg C ha-1 yr-1). Virtually all forest lands were accumulating C in live biomass, however when the net change in total ecosystem C stock was considered, 19% of the forest area were a net source of C. The average net C sink in total ecosystem biomass is quite weak (0.08 MgC ha-1 yr-1 and could be reversed by minor increases in harvest rates or a small decline in biomass growth rates. © 2004 Kluwer Academic Publishers.",,"Carbon; Forestry; Harvesting; Inventory control; Remote sensing; Carbon sinks; Data sources; Forest inventories; Harvest rates; Ecosystems; biomass; carbon sequestration; forest inventory; Landsat; remote sensing; satellite imagery; Carbon; Ecosystems; Forests; Harvesting; Inventory Control; Remote Sensing; Eastern Hemisphere; Eurasia; Russian Federation; World","National Science Foundation, NSF: DEB-9632921; National Aeronautics and Space Administration, NASA: NAG5-11250, NAG5-6242","Research was conducted at Oregon State University (OSU) with support from NASA LCLUC program (NAG5-6242 and NAG5-11250) and the National Science Foundation LTER program (DEB-9632921).

For current radar satellite data, only the biomass of young/sparse forests or regrowth after disturbances can be recovered. An example from central Siberia illustrates that biomass can be measured by radar at a continental scale, and that a significant proportion of the Siberian forests have biomass values less than 50 tonnes/ha. Comparison between the radar map and calculations by the Sheffield Dynamic Global Vegetation Model (SDGVM) indicates that the model considerably overestimates biomass; under-representation of managed areas, disturbed areas and areas of low site quality in the model are suggested reasons for this effect. A case study carried out at the Büdingen plantation forest in Germany supports the argument that inadequate representations of site quality and forest management may cause model overestimates of biomass. Comparison of the calculated biomass of stands planted after 1990 with biomass estimates by radar allows identification of forest stands where the growth conditions assumed by the model are not valid. This allows a quality check on model calculations of carbon fluxes: only calculations for stands where there is good agreement between the data and the model predictions should be accepted. Although the paper only uses the SDGVM model, similar effects are likely in other dynamic vegetation models, and the results show that model calculations attempting to quantify the role of forests as carbon sources or sinks could be qualified and potentially improved by exploiting remotely sensed measurements of biomass. © 2004 Kluwer Academic Publishers.",,"Biomass; Carbon; Forestry; Radar; Satellite communication systems; Vegetation; Carbon sources; Radar satellite data; Sheffield dynamic global vegetation model (SDGVM); Vegetation model; Remote sensing; carbon budget; radar; remote sensing; Biomass; Carbon; Forestry; Plants; Radar; Remote Sensing; Satellites",,,,,,,,,,,,"Le Toan, T.; Ctr. d'Etud.

Here we present a canopy height quantile-based approach for quantifying above ground carbon content (AGCC) in a temperate deciduous woodland, by means of a discrete-return, small-footprint airborne LiDAR. Fieldwork was conducted in Monks Wood National Nature Reserve UK to estimate the AGCC of five stands from forest mensuration and allometric relations. In parallel, a digital canopy height model (DCHM) and a digital terrain model (DTM) were derived from elevation measurements obtained by means of an Optech Airborne Laser Terrain Mapper 1210. A quantile-based approach was adopted to select a representative statistic of height distributions per plot. A forestry yield model was selected as a basis to estimate stemwood volume per plot from these heights metrics. Agreement of r=0.74 at the plot level was achieved between ground-based AGCC estimates and those derived from the DCHM. Using a 20x20 m grids superposed to the DCHM, the AGCC was estimated at the stand level and at the woodland level. At the stand level, the agreement between the plot data upscaled in proportion to area and the LiDAR estimates was r=0.85. At the woodland level, LiDAR estimates were nearly 24% lower than those from the upscaled plot data. This suggests that field-based approaches alone may not be adequate for carbon accounting in heterogeneous forests. Conversely, the LiDAR 20x20 m grid approach has an enhanced capability of monitoring the natural variability of AGCC across the woodland. © 2004 Elsevier Inc.

Although AGB is an important variable for evaluating ecosystem function and structure across the landscape, such estimates are difficult to generate without high-resolution satellite data. This study bridges the application of remote sensing techniques with various forest management practices in Chequamegon National Forest (CNF), Wisconsin, USA by producing a high-resolution stand age map and a spatially explicit AGB map. We coupled AGB values, calculated from field measurements of tree dbh, with various vegetation indices derived from Landsat 7 ETM+ data through multiple regression analyses to produce an initial biomass map. The initial biomass map was overlaid with a land-cover map to generate a stand age map. Biomass threshold values for each age category (e.g., young, intermediate, and mature) were determined through field observations and frequency analysis of initial biomass estimates by major cover types. We found that AGB estimates for hardwood forests were strongly related to stand age and near-infrared reflectance (r 2=0.95) while the AGB for pine forests was strongly related to the corrected normalized difference vegetation index (NDVIc; r 2=0.86). Separating hardwoods from pine forests improved the AGB estimates in the area substantially, compared to overall regression (r 2=0.82). Our AGB results are comparable to previously reported values in the area. The total amount of AGB in the study area for 2001 was estimated as 3.3 million metric tons (dry weight), 76.5% of which was in hardwood and mixed hardwood/pine forests. AGB ranged from 1 to 358 Mg/ha with an average of 70 and a standard deviation of 54 Mg/ha. The AGB class with the highest percentage (16.1%) was between 81 and 100 Mg/ha. Forests with biomass values &gt;200 Mg/ha accounted for less than 3% of the study area and were usually associated with mature hardwood forests. Estimated AGB was validated using independent field measurements (R 2=0.67, p&lt;0.001). The AGB and age maps can be used as baseline information for future landscape level studies such as quantifying the regional carbon budget, accumulating fuel, or monitoring management practices. © 2004 Elsevier Inc.

The five primary fire produced pollutants were carbon monoxide (CO), sulphur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), ozone (O3) and particulate matter less than 10 μm (PM10). The first four of these are, of course, invisible to conventional satellite-flown multispectral scanners operating in the visible and near infrared regions of the electromagnetic spectrum. The fifth, PM10, is present in the haze and therefore makes an observable contribution to the signal received by the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR). The haze in AVHRR channels 1 and 2 data for the fires of September 1997 has been used to study the concentration of PM10 directly. It has also been used to study the concentration indirectly - as a tracer or surrogate - for the four remaining materials, the gases CO, SO2, NO2 and O3. Data from ground observations have been used to calibrate the results and the distributions of the fire pollutants over Peninsular Malaysia have been plotted. © 2004 Taylor &amp; Francis Ltd.",,"Air pollution; Carbon; Electromagnetic fields; Fire hazards; Infrared radiation; Multispectral scanners; Nitrogen compounds; Ozone; Particulate emissions; Radiometry; Satellites; Sulfur; Advanced very high resolution radiometer (AVHRR); Fire pollutants; Forest fires; Near infrared regions; Remote sensing; atmospheric pollution; AVHRR; carbon monoxide; forest fire; particulate matter; sulfur dioxide; troposphere; Asia; Eastern Hemisphere; Eurasia; Southeast Asia; World",,"This study was made possible due to funding from the Ministry of Science, Technology and the Environment, Malaysia.

It stems from the distribution in height of the backscattering cross section in a imaged scene, and it widely affects interferometric coherence images, e.g., in the presence of forests or buildings. The interest in its reduction lies on the fact that ""resolving"" volume decorrelation and fixing the exact position of the scattering centers in a resolution cell may lead to an estimation of the height of the observed distributed scatterers. Indeed, the determination of the volume scattering contribution is determinant in digital elevation model generation as well as in biomass estimation. However, volume decorrelation itself may be a source of information on the mechanisms that originate it. In this paper, a distinction is made between the behavior of volume decorrelation due to random volumes and stationary distributed targets. The two cases are then studied by means of polarimetry: the response of such targets to different polarizations is considered by applying a series of decompositions of the scattering matrix, and a systematic analysis of the interferometric coherence characteristics is reported.","Polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (SAR) interferometry; Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) polarimetry; Target decomposition theorems; Volume decorrelation sources","Backscattering; Interferometry; Matrix algebra; Natural frequencies; Parameter estimation; Polarimeters; Rayleigh scattering; Remote sensing; Digital elevation models (DEM); Scattering matrix; Target decomposition theorems; Volume decorrelation sources; Synthetic aperture radar","European Commission, EC","Manuscript received March 29, 2004; revised July 27, 2004.

Generally, this information is obtained in the age class attribute of forest inventories; however forest inventories can become quickly outdated when disturbance events are not continuously integrated into the database. In this study, Landsat ETM+ image data and Tasseled Cap index values were used to estimate the age of lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta) stands from the approximate time of disturbance to 20 years of regeneration. An image segmentation procedure aided the removal of pixels representative of residual forest and other non-characteristic stand conditions within forest inventory polygons, in order to isolate the pixels representative of regenerating harvested forest. A stepwise multivariate regression procedure was used to estimate stand age for harvested areas, and an R 2 of 0.68 (with a standard error of less than 2.4 years) was computed. This transferable approach provides useful information for forest C accounting when the year of disturbance, or the age of subsequent regeneration, is required for estimating C stocks. © 2004 Elsevier Inc.

However, there are reports of significant differences in predominant fire type between these regions, which may have major implications for overall emissions of carbon, gases and aerosols. We examine boreal forest fire intensities via MODIS observations of fire radiative energy release rate. Results support the contention of a consistent difference in fire intensity and mean fuel consumption in Russia and North America, due to differences in dominant fire type. North American fires have higher mean intensities, increasing in proportion to percentage tree cover, characteristics indicating likely crown fire dominance. Russian fires have lower mean intensities, independent of percentage tree cover, characteristics more indicative of surface fire activity. Per unit area burnt, the results suggest Russian fires may burn less fuel and emit fewer products to the atmosphere than do those in North America.

The species included two native trees, cottonwood (Populus fremontii) and willow (Salix gooddingii), and two salt-tolerant shrubs, saltcedar (Tamarix ramosissima) and arrowweed (Pluchia sericea), exhibiting large differences in leaf type and canopy architecture. LAI was measured with a Licor 2000 plant canopy analyzer calibrated against biomass measurements of LAI, whereas NDVI was measured by low-level aerial photography using a DyCam digital camera with Red (R)-Blue (B)-near infrared (NIR) bands. In addition, reflectance spectra were measured for leaf samples collected from plants in the field. Leaf samples of all species had similar reflectance spectra in the visible (VIS) and NIR, hence similar NDVI values, ranging from 0.62 to 0.72 (P&gt;0.05). LAI values of field plants varied over a relatively narrow range, with mean values of 3.50, 3.28, 2.81 and 3.69 for cottonwood, willow, saltcedar and arrowweed, respectively. However, field plants showed distinct species differences in NDVI, with the following mean values: cottonwood (0.686), willow (0.600), saltcedar (0.473) and arrowweed (0.254) (all significantly different at P&lt;0.05). Differences in NDVI among field plants could be explained by differences in the light extinction coefficient, k, for plant canopies, according to the formula: fIRs=(1-e-kLAI), where fIRs is the fraction of incident light intercepted by the canopy. At one extreme, cottonwood had broad leaves that faced the sun, and a calculated k of 1.25, whereas at the other extreme, arrowweed had linear leaves that were near to vertical, and had a k of 0.15. Ecophysiological implications of the differences among the species are discussed. © 2004 Elsevier B.V.

The simulations suggest that annual net uptake (net ecosystem production (NEP)) for the whole forested region (8.2 million hectares) was 13.8Tg C (168g Cm-2 yr-1), with the highest mean uptake in the Coast Range ecoregion (226 g Cm-2 yr-1), and the lowest mean NEP in the East Cascades (EC) ecoregion (88 g Cm-2 yr-1). Carbon stocks totaled 2765 Tg C (33 700 g Cm-2), with wide variability among ecoregions in the mean stock and in the partitioning above- and belowground. The flux of carbon from the land to the atmosphere that is driven by wildfire was relatively low during the late 1990s ( ∼ 0.1 Tg Cyr-1), however, wildfires in 2002 generated a much larger C source ( ∼ 4.1 Tg C). Annual harvest removals from the study area over the period 1995-2000 were ∼ 5.5 Tg Cyr-1. The removals were disproportionately from the Coast Range, which is heavily managed for timber production (approximately 50% of all of Oregon's forest land has been managed for timber in the past 5 years). The estimate for the annual increase in C stored in long-lived forest products and land fills was 1.4 Tg Cyr-1. Net biome production (NBP) on the land, the net effect of NEP, harvest removals, and wildfire emissions indicates that the study area was a sink (8.2 Tg Cyr-1). NBP of the study area, which is the more heavily forested half of the state, compensated for ∼ 52% of Oregon's fossil carbon dioxide emissions of 15.6 Tg Cyr-1 in 2000. The Biscuit Fire in 2002 reduced NBP dramatically, exacerbating net emissions that year. The regional total reflects the strong east-west gradient in potential productivity associated with the climatic gradient, and a disturbance regime that has been dominated in recent decades by commercial forestry. © 2004 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","Carbon allocation; Carbon balance; Carbon flux; Carbon stocks; Conifer forests; Net primary production; Respiration; Soil carbon","carbon budget; carbon flux; climate effect; disturbance; ecoregion; net ecosystem production; North America; Oregon; United States; Coniferophyta",,,,,,,,,,,,"Law, B.E.; College of Forestry, , Corvallis, OR 97331-5752, United States; email: bev.law@oregonstate.edu",,,13541013,,,,"English","Global Change Biol.",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-4744363331

In practice, selecting suitable image data for such purposes remains difficult due to a poor understanding of forest stand parameters and remote-sensing spectral response relationships, particularly in moist tropical regions. This paper explores relationships between forest stand parameters and Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) spectral responses through analyses of three study areas in the eastern Amazon basin (Altamira, Bragantina, and Ponta de Pedras). Six TM bands and many vegetation indices are examined through integration of spectral responses and field vegetation inventory data. Pearson's correlation coefficients are used to interpret relationships between forest stand parameters and TM data. This study concludes that single band TM5 and linear transformed indices such as PC1 (the first component in a principal component analysis), KT1 (brightness of the tasseled cap transform), and albedo are most strongly correlated with forest stand parameters, somewhat independent of biophysical environments. Many vegetation indices that use TM4 and TM3 data, such as the atmospherically resistant vegetation index, the atmospheric and soil vegetation index, and the normalized difference vegetation index, are weakly correlated with selected forest stand parameters. In contrast, vegetation indices using band TM5 data improve correlations with selected forest stand parameters in Altamira forests that are characterized by a complex stand structure. Forest stand structure and associated canopy shadow affect the forest stand parameters and TM spectral response relationships. This paper provides a better understanding of relationships that have a potential of being important for developing stand parameter estimation models and for improvement of vegetation classification accuracy. © 2004 Elsevier B.V.

Urgent tasks in this regard are the provision of information on the fire locations and magnitude of the carbon emissions. The experimental Bi-spectral InfraRed Detection (BIRD) satellite enables early detection of peat swamp forest fires and retrieval of their quantitative characteristics, such as the effective fire temperature, area and radiative energy release.

Currently, remote sensing emerges as a useful toot for estimating NPP through monitoring global vegetation distribution and growth. The objective of this study was to utilize the multi-year monthly Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) dataset of 1987-1997 from the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) to investigate the interannual variation in productivity of global vegetation due to climate variation, human activities, and environmental events. A decision tree algorithm based on simple metrics (minimum, maximum, mean and amplitude) was employed to classify the global vegetation from NDVI data and obtain the annual vegetation growth areas. Then, annual NPP was computed using the annual vegetation growth areas and the predefined NPP coefficients given in a 1990 Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report. The NPP exhibited a slightly increasing trend through the 11 years. However, interannual variations were observed to be mainly determined by variation in growth of tropical and temperate evergreen forests. These fluctuations were consistently correlated to El Niõ/La Niã events. Although the interannual variation in primary productivity of global vegetation is expected to influence the atmospheric CO2 concentration over the one-decade period, it is unlikely to have solely caused the anomalously low growth in 1992-1993. The adopted methodology enabled close examination of variability in vegetation growth at the biome scale as well as at global scale. © 2004 Taylor and Francis Ltd.",,"Algorithms; Carbon dioxide; Climate change; Vegetation; Global carbon cycle; Terrestrial biosphere; Remote sensing; annual variation; carbon cycle; climate variation; NDVI; net primary production",,,,,,,,,,,,"Babiker, I.S.; Laboratory of Stable Isotopess, , Furo-cho, Nagoya 464-8601, Japan; email: s010103d@mbox.nagoya-u.ac.jp",,"Taylor and Francis Ltd.",01431161,,IJSED,,"English","Int.

A new photosynthesis model has been created that combines the standard sunlit/shaded leaf separation (two-leaf) and the multiple layer approaches and uses vertical foliage profiles measured by SLICER (the Scanning Lidar Imager of Canopies by Echo Recovery). Daily gross carbon assimilation rates calculated by this model were compared with the rates calculated by two other models, the two-leaf model and the combined two-leaf multilayer model utilizing uniform foliage profiles. The comparison was made over a wide range of profiles and weather conditions for two mixed deciduous forest stands in eastern Maryland, measured by SLICER in September 1995. Incident radiation pattern, environmental parameters and total amounts of sunlit and shaded leaves were the same for all three models. The difference was in the distributions of radiation and sunlit/shaded leaves inside the canopy. For the combined models, these distributions were calculated based on the vertical foliage profiles, while for the two-leaf model, empirical equations were used to account for the average amounts of absorbed radiation. The simulations showed that: (1) the use of a uniform foliage distribution instead of the actual one results in large differences in the calculated GPP values, up to 46.4% and 50.7% for the days with partial and total cloud cover; (2) the performance of the two-leaf model is extremely sensitive to the absorbed radiation pattern, its disagreement with the proposed model becomes insignificant when the average amounts of absorbed radiation are the same; (3) days with partial cloud cover and a greater fraction of diffuse radiation are characterized by higher GPP rates. These findings highlight the importance of vertical foliage profile and separate treatments of diffuse and direct radiation for photosynthesis modeling. © 2004 Elsevier Inc.

In addition, the spatial dependency of residuals between ground-measured and lidar-estimated variables was investigated. The lidar data set was acquired over deciduous and pine stands in the southeastern United States. Individual trees were identified on the lidar-derived canopy height model by local maximum focal filtering with both square and circular windows of variable size. The size of the dynamically varying window was based on the height of the canopy and the taxonomic group as derived from coregistered multispectral optical data. Lidar-measured parameters at an individual tree level (height, crown diameter) were used with regression models and cross validation to estimate plot-level field inventory data, including volume, biomass, basal area, and diameter at breast height (dbh). Maximum R2 values for estimating biomass were 0.32 for deciduous trees (RMSE 44 Mg/ha) and 0.82 for pines (RMSE 29 Mg/ha). When estimating volume, maximum R2 values for deciduous trees were 0.39 (RMSE 52.84 m3/ha) and 0.83 for pines (RMSE 47.9 m3/ha). Calculation of Moran's / coefficient for each regression model revealed a lack of significant autocorellation of the residuals at 0.05 level. Both model fit and prediction for volume and biomass models for deciduous and pine plots indicated that the circular window shape is more appropriate to locate individual trees with lidar. Using the fused data set, lidar and optical imagery, as opposed to using lidar data alone, always improved biomass and volume estimates for pines and in some cases for deciduous plots as well.","Basal area; dbh; Spatial autocorrelation; Tree height","Biomass; Data acquisition; Growth kinetics; Imaging techniques; Optical radar; Forest volume; Growth rates; Multispectral datas; Forestry; Biomass; Data Processing; Forestry; Growth Rate; Image Analysis; Radar",,,,,,,,,,,,"Popescu, S.C.; Spatial Sciences Laboratory, 1500 Research Parkway, College Station, TX 77845, United States; email: s-popescu@tamu.edu",,,0015749X,,FOSCA,,"English","For.

The value/use of high-resolution satellite data of Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) to estimate tree density, basal area, basal volume, and forest biomass was investigated under an operational perspective in a spatially heterogeneous Mediterranean landscape in northern Greece. Digital classification using Fisher's linear discriminant functions produced an overall accuracy of 82%. A series of multispectral transformations were also performed, and the derivative synthetic channels were used along with the original ones as explanatory variables in the model developed. The forest stand parameters that were investigated in the study presented a similar but weak correlation with the Landsat-5 TM spectral channels. Among them, TM4 and TM7 presented the highest correlation with forest stand parameters, while the integration of the derivative synthetic channels increased the correlation coefficients and resulted in statistically significant predictive models.","Abrupt relief; Forest stand parameters; Landsat TM; Regression models","Channel capacity; Digital storage; Ecosystems; Monitoring; Satellite communication systems; Forest biomass; Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM); Multispectral transformations; Synthetic channels; Tree density; Forestry; Digital Systems; Ecosystems; Forestry; Monitoring; Satellites; Martes pennanti",,,,,,,,,,,,"Mallinis, G.; Lab.

Most of these models are based on an iterative solution of the radiative transfer equation, usually solved up to first or second order, thus taking into account single and double scattering. Although this method leads to results agreeing well with copolarized backscatter measurements, it produces less accurate estimates for horizontal-vertical (HV) polarization. This paper presents a radiative transfer backscatter model that accounts for multiple scattering by using the discrete ordinate and eigenvalue method applied to a layered medium. Using parameters derived from an architectural tree model, calculations at C- and L-band are compared with HV data acquired for a maritime pine forest in the southwest of France during the Spaceborne Imaging Radar-C missions. Good agreement is found at C-band for all values of forest biomass, and reasonable agreement at L-band for high biomass, when the soil backscatter plays a minor role. For low biomass, the L-band modeling is inadequate because of difficulties in estimating the soil backscatter. Comparison with calculations from a first-order radiative transfer model shows that multiple scattering is significant, especially at C-band.","Cross polarization; Discrete ordinate method; Forest biomass; Radiative transfer modeling; Synthetic aperture radar (SAR)","Biomass; Computer simulation; Copolymerization; Data reduction; Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions; Electromagnetic wave polarization; Forestry; Parameter estimation; Remote sensing; Synthetic aperture radar; Cross polarization; Discrete ordinate methods; Forest biomass; Relative transfer modeling; Electromagnetic wave backscattering; Biomass; Copolymerization; Electromagnetic Radiation; Forestry; Polarized Light; Remote Sensing",,,,,,,,,,,,"Picard, G.; Ctr.

Ecological studies in LBA focus on how tropical forest conversion, regrowth, and selective logging influence carbon storage, nutrient dynamics, trace gas fluxes, and the prospect for sustainable land use in the Amazon region. Early results from ecological studies within LBA emphasize the variability within the vast Amazon region and the profound effects that land-use and land-cover changes are having on that landscape. The predominant land cover of the Amazon region is evergreen forest; nonetheless, LBA studies have observed strong seasonal patterns in gross primary production, ecosystem respiration, and net ecosystem exchange, as well as phenology and tree growth. The seasonal patterns vary spatially and interannually and evidence suggests that these patterns are driven not only by variations in weather but also by innate biological rhythms of the forest species. Rapid rates of deforestation have marked the forests of the Amazon region over the past three decades. Evidence from ground-based surveys and remote sensing show that substantial areas of forest are being degraded by logging activities and through the collapse of forest edges. Because forest edges and logged forests are susceptible to fire, positive feedback cycles of forest degradation may be initiated by land-use-change events. LBA studies indicate that cleared lands in the Amazon, once released from cultivation or pasture usage, regenerate biomass rapidly. However, the pace of biomass accumulation is dependent upon past land use and the depletion of nutrients by unsustainable land-management practices. The challenge for ongoing research within LBA is to integrate the recognition of diverse patterns and processes into general models for prediction of regional ecosystem function.","Amazon; Carbon; Cerrado; Land-use and land-cover change; LBA; Nutrients; Oxisol; Savanna; Trace gases; Tropical forest; Ultisol","atmosphere-biosphere interaction; carbon sequestration; ecosystem function; gas exchange; habitat management; land use change; nutrient dynamics; regeneration; sustainable development; tropical forest; Amazonia; South America",,,,,,,,,,,,"Keller, M.; University of New Hampshire, , Durham, NH 03824, United States; email: michael.keller@unh.edu",,,10510761,,ECAPE,,"English","Ecol.

In fact, the area and type of vegetation that is burned on a monthly or annual basis are two of the parameters that provide the greatest uncertainty in the calculation of gas and aerosol emissions and burned biomass. To address this need, an inventory of burned areas at monthly time periods for the year 2000 at a resolution of 1 km2 has been produced using satellite data and has been made freely available to the scientific community. In this paper, estimates of burned area and number of burn scars for four broad vegetation classes and reported at the country level for the year 2000 are presented using data taken from the inventory. Over 3.5 million km2 of burned areas were detected in the year 2000, of which approximately 80% occurred in areas described as woodlands and shrublands. Approximately 17% of the burned area occurred in grasslands and croplands, the remaining 3% occurred in forests. Almost 600,000 separate burn scars were detected. Descriptions of vegetation burning activity are given for ten regions. Finally, monthly burned area estimates are presented for the Central African Republic to illustrate the usefulness of these data for understanding, monitoring and managing vegetation burning activities.

For this purpose, CO2 and meteorological parameters were measured from a small aircraft during four flights in June 2001 over a flat homogeneous and productive temperate forest in the Landes region (southwestern France). Additional CO measurements were made in order to identify and quantify the potential influence of anthropogenic emissions on the net CO2 flux derived from the measurements. For one of four flights, Lagrangian conditions were nearly perfectly fulfilled. On average, the CO2 mixing ratio in the boundary layer decreased at a rate of 0.11 ppm km-1, yielding an average CO2 uptake by the forest of 16 ± 2.5 μmol m-2 s-1 between 1230 and 1430 UT. Our result is about 15% smaller than the local net ecosystem exchange measured by eddy covariance at a tower north of the flight domain and about 12% higher than a regional estimate based on remote sensing data for the whole experimental area. The contribution of anthropogenic emissions to the regional CO2 budget was estimated from the CO measurements to be to &lt;0.5 μmol m-2 S-1.

Because Siberia is located where some of the largest temperature increases are expected to occur under current climate change scenarios, stored carbon has the potential to be released with associated changes in fire regimes. Our concentration is on estimating a wide range of current and potential emissions from Siberia on the basis of three modeled scenarios. An area burned product of Siberia is introduced, which spans from 1998 through 2002. Emissions models are spatially explicit; therefore area burned is extracted from associated ecoregions for each year. Carbon consumption estimates are presented for 23 unique ecoregions across Siberia, which range from 3.4 to 75.4 t C ha-1 for three classes of severity. Total direct carbon emissions range from the traditional scenario estimate of 116 Tg C in 1999 (6.9 M ha burned) to the extreme scenario estimate of 520 Tg C in 2002 (11.2 M ha burned), which are equivalent to 5 and 20%, respectively, of total global carbon emissions from forest and grassland burning. Our results suggest that disparities in the amount of carbon stored in unique ecosystems and the severity of fire events can affect total direct carbon emissions by as much as 50%. Additionally, in extreme fire years, total direct carbon emissions can be 37-41% greater than in normal fire years, owing to increased soil organic matter consumption. Mean standard scenario estimates of CO2 (555-1031 Tg), CO (43-80 Tg), CH4 (2.4-4.5 Tg , TNMHC (2.2-4.1 Tg), and carbonaceous aerosols (4.6-8.6 Tg) represent 10, 15, 19, 12 and 26%, respectively, of the global estimates from forest and grassland burning. Accounting for smoldering combustion in soils and peatlands results in increases in CO, CH4, and TNMHC and decreases in CO2 emitted from fire events.

GWEM computes monthly emissions of more than 40 chemical compounds and aerosols from forest and savanna fires. This study focuses on an evaluation of the GLOBSCAR data set. The GWEM version presented here makes use of the Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) land cover map. Emission totals for the year 2000 are 1741 Tg C, 5716 Tg CO2, 271 Tg CO, 12.52 Tg CH4, 9.09 Tg C (as nonmethane hydrocarbons), 8.08 Tg NOx, (as NO), 24.30 Tg PM2.5, 15.80 Tg OC, and 1.84 Tg black carbon. These emissions are lower than other estimates found in literature. An evaluation assesses the uncertainties of the individual input data. The GLOBSCAR product yields reasonable estimates of burnt area for large wildland fires in most parts of the globe but experiences problems in some regions where small fires dominate. The seasonality derived from GLOBSCAR differs from other satellite products detecting active fires owing to the different algorithms applied. Application of the presented GWEM results in global chemistry transport modeling will require additional treatment of small deforestation fires in the tropical rain forest regions and small savanna fires, mainly in subequatorial Africa. Further improvements are expected from a more detailed description of the carbon pools and the inclusion of anthropogenic disturbances in the LPJ model.

Despite uncertainties related to radiation use efficiency, the amount of photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) intercepted by the canopy is a reliable estimator of primary production. Theoretical and empirical data support the relationship between the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) derived from the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer sensor on National Oceanic & Atmospheric Administration satellites and the fraction of PAR intercepted by green canopies. It is shown, for the period 1981-2000, that there is an overall increase in the radiation intercepted by the canopy over South America by 1.3%, with rainforests making the largest absolute contribution (45%), followed by savannas (23%). Under conditions of minimal agricultural use, disturbance and anthropogenic N deposition, humid temperate forests showed the highest proportional increase in NDVI during the last two decades (4.9%). Deserts showed a net reduction in NDVI relative to the 1981-1985 average (-4.4%). The expansion of agriculture over the last two decades was associated with NDVI reductions over subtropical forests. NDVI trends in South American region highlight a biome-dependent imprint of major global change noticeable in only two decades. © 2004 Taylor and Francis Ltd.",,"Agriculture; Economic and social effects; Photosynthesis; Solar radiation; Vegetation; Carbon uptake; Normalized difference vegetation index; Remote sensing; AVHRR; forest canopy; global change; NDVI; photosynthetically active radiation; primary production; remote sensing; South America","CRN 012, ISP III 077, PESCA 010; Fundación Antorchas; Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Científicas y Técnicas, CONICET; Universidad de Buenos Aires, UBA","This work was supported by University of Buenos Aires (Proyecto estratégico), CONICET (Argentina), Fundación Antorchas, PROYUNGAS and the Inter American Institute for Global Change Studies (ISP III 077, PESCA 010 and CRN 012).

We used mapped and dated fire scars as a reference and developed a remote sensing algorithm for mapping boreal forest stand age distribution that accounts for other stand-replacing disturbances such as harvesting. Considering its strong discriminatory capacity on vegetation type and stand age, a short-wave vegetation index (SWVI) (Remote Sensing of Environment 82 (2002) 95), calculated from the SPOT VEGETATION (VGT) near-infrared and short-wave infrared bands, was utilized to quantify forest regeneration following fire. Stand age of a pixel was then determined by its SWVI value in comparison with the known ones from the dated fire scars. A change indicator (Latifovic, R. (2001). VGT and AVHRR Manager User manual. Canada Centre for Remote Sensing, Natural Resources Canada. Ottawa, Ontario, Canada), which considered interannual changes in the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) from sequential NOAA Advanced Very-High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) imagery (1993-1998), was employed to differentiate areas with lower SWVI values resulting from biophysical factors other than disturbances. We evaluated the stand age distribution product using Landsat TM imagery and discussed the limits and constraints of the remote sensing approach of deriving stand age distribution in the boreal forest region. © 2004 Elsevier Inc.

One class (fine texture, trees of uniform crown diameter and height) covered about half the area; it was identified as second growth originating after a large regional fire in 1845. The other major class (coarse texture, trees of variable crown diameter and height), occupying about 35% of the area, was unburned or partially burned in 1845. The third class (openings with down stems visible on the ground) was blowdown patches. The blowdown patches were very small in 1953; they grew incrementally, and by 1994 had coalesced into a large patch occupying about 15% of the area. A long-term windstorm susceptibility model developed for southeast Alaska identified the region where the blowdown patch occurred as being very susceptible to maritime windstorm disturbance. This correspondence between predicted susceptibility to damage and actual blowdown supports the hypothesis that windstorm effects may be strongly constrained by topography. The results also suggest that blowdown in storm-susceptible topographic settings can be the result of multiple windstorm events over time, rather than a single event. The resulting forest is a mosaic of large multi-aged chronic-disturbance patches embedded in a matrix structured by fine-scale patch processes. A consequence of a constraint on blowdown is that at the scale of hundreds of hectares biomass may not fluctuate strongly over time unless stand-destroying fires occur. © 2004 Elsevier B.V.

This study reviews ecosystem process models designed to predict the growth and productivity of temperate and tropical forest ecosystems. Temperate forest models were included because of the minimal number of tropical forest models. The review provides a multiscale assessment enabling potential users to select a model suited to the scale and type of information they require in tropical forests. Process models are reviewed in relation to their input and output parameters, minimum spatial and temporal units of operation, maximum spatial extent and time period of application for each organization level of modelling. Organizational levels included leaf-tree, plot-stand, regional and ecosystem levels, with model complexity decreasing as the time-step and spatial extent of model operation increases. All ecosystem models are simplified versions of reality and are typically aspatial. Remotely sensed data sets and derived products may be used to initialize, drive and validate ecosystem process models. At the simplest level, remotely sensed data are used to delinnt location, extent and changes over time of vegetation communities. At a more advanced level, remotely sensed data products have been used to estimate key structural and biophysical properties associated with ecosystem processes in tropical and temperate forests. Combining ecological models and image data enables the development of carbon accounting systems that will contribute to understanding greenhouse gas budgets at biome and global scales. © Arnold 2004.","Carbon cycle; Ecosystem process models; Remote sensing; Scaling carbon fluxes; Tropical forests","carbon cycle; carbon flux; ecosystem modeling; mapping method; remote sensing; tropical forest",,,,,,,,,,,,"Nightingale, J.M.; Biophysical Remote Sensing Group, , Brisbane, 4072, Australia; email: s350141@student.uq.edu.au",,,03091333,,,,"English","Prog.

CO2 flux measurements at individual CO2 eddy flux sites provide valuable information on the seasonal dynamics of GPP. In this paper, we developed and validated the satellite-based Vegetation Photosynthesis Model (VPM), using site-specific CO2 flux and climate data from a temperate deciduous broadleaf forest at Harvard Forest, Massachusetts, USA. The VPM model is built upon the conceptual partitioning of photosynthetically active vegetation and non-photosynthetic vegetation (NPV) within the leaf and canopy. It estimates GPP, using satellite-derived Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI), Land Surface Water Index (LSWI), air temperature and photosynthetically active radiation (PAR). Multi-year (1998-2001) data analyses have shown that EVI had a stronger linear relationship with GPP than did the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI). Two simulations of the VPM model were conducted, using vegetation indices from the VEGETATION (VGT) sensor onboard the SPOT-4 satellite and the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) sensor onboard the Terra satellite. The predicted GPP values agreed reasonably well with observed GPP of the deciduous broadleaf forest at Harvard Forest, Massachusetts. This study highlighted the biophysical performance of improved vegetation indices in relation to GPP and demonstrated the potential of the VPM model for scaling-up of GPP of deciduous broadleaf forests. © 2004 Elsevier Inc.

To do this, data from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectoradiometer were used in combination with precipitation, temperature, and elevation data. The results show that coarse resolution remotely sensed data in combination with relevant topographic and climate data can be used to map above-ground biomass with good accuracy over large areas. For the data sets considered, empirical models based on a 2 percent sample explained 73 percent of the variance in biomass in the remaining 98 percent of the data with a root mean square error of 44.4 tons/ha.

However, our understanding of biogeochemical dynamics in pasturelands remains poor, especially when attempting to scale up predictions of C cycle changes. A wide range of pasture ages, soil types, management strategies, and climates make remote sensing the only realistic means to regionalize our understanding of pasture biogeochemistry and C cycling over such an enormous geographic area. However, the use of remote sensing has been impeded by a lack of effective links between variables that can be observed from satellites (e.g. live and senescent biomass) and variables that cannot be observed, but which may drive key changes in C storage and trace gas fluxes (e.g. soil nutrient status). We studied patterns in canopy biophysical-biochemical properties and soil biogeochemical processes along pasture age gradients on two important soil types in the central Amazon. Our goals were to (1) improve our understanding of the plot-scale biogeochemical dynamics of this land-use change, (2) evaluate the effects of pasture development on two contrasting soil types (clayey Oxisols and sandy Entisols), and (3) attempt to use remotely sensed variables to scale up the site-specific variability in biogeochemical conditions of pasturelands. The biogeochemical analyses showed that (1) aboveground and soil C stocks decreased with pasture age on both clayey and sandy soils, (2) declines in plant biomass were well correlated with declines in soil C and with available phosphorus (P) and calcium (Ca), and (3) despite low initial values for total and available soil P, ecosystem P stocks declined further with pasture age, as did a number of other nutrients. Spectral mixture analysis of Landsat imagery provided estimates of photosynthetic vegetation (PV) and non-photosynthetic vegetation (NPV) that were highly correlated with field measurements of these variables and plant biomass. In turn, the remotely sensed sum PV + NPV was well correlated with the changes in soil organic carbon and nitrogen, and available P and Ca. These results suggest that remote sensing can be an excellent indicator of not only pasture area, but of pasture condition and C storage, thereby greatly improving regional estimates of the environmental consequences of such land-use change. © 2004 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","Amazon basin; Base cations; Brazil; Calcium; Deforestation; Land-use change; Nitrogen; Nutrient cycling; Pastures; Phosphorus; Tropical forest","carbon cycle; land use change; nutrient cycling; remote sensing; soil carbon; Amazon Basin; South America; Bos taurus; Nucleopolyhedrovirus",,,,,,,,,,,,"Asner, G.P.; Carnegie Institution, 260 Panama Street, Stanford, CA 94305, United States; email: gpa@stanford.edu",,,13541013,,,,"English","Global Change Biol.",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-2642554825

Satellite remote sensing (passive and active microwave) of the temporally varying extent of inundation and vegetation was combined with field measurements to calculate regional rates of methane emission for Amazonian wetlands. Monthly inundation areas for the fringing floodplains of the mainstem Solimões/Amazon River were derived from analysis of the 37 GHz polarization difference observed by the Scanning Multichannel Microwave Radiometer from 1979 to 1987. L-band synthetic aperture radar data (Japanese Earth Resources Satellite-1) were used to determine inundation and wetland vegetation for the Amazon basin (&lt;500 m elevation) at high (May-June 1996) and low water (October 1995). An extensive set of measurements of methane emission is available from the literature for the fringing floodplains of the central Amazon, segregated into open water, flooded forest and floating macrophyte habitats. Uncertainties in the regional emission rates were determined by Monte Carlo error analyses that combined error estimates for the measurements of emission and for calculations of inundation and habitat areas. The mainstem Solimões/Amazon floodplain (54-70°W) emitted methane at a mean annual rate of 1.3 Tg C yr-1, with a standard deviation (SD) of the mean of 0.3 Tg C yr-1; 67% of this range in uncertainty is owed to the range in rates of methane emission and 33% is owed to uncertainty in the areal estimates of inundation and vegetative cover. Methane emission from a 1.77 million square kilometers area in the central basin had a mean of 6.8 Tg C yr-1 with a SD of 1.3 Tg C yr-1. If extrapolated to the whole basin below the 500 m contour, approximately 22 Tg C yr-1 is emitted; this mean flux has a greenhouse warming potential of about 0.5 Pg C as CO2. Improvement of these regional estimates will require many more field measurements of methane emission, further examination of remotely sensed data for types of wetlands not represented in the central basin, and process-based models of methane production and emission. © 2004 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","Amazon; Biogeochemistry; Carbon; Methane; Microwave remote sensing; Wetlands","biogeochemical cycle; methane; microwave imagery; Monte Carlo analysis; remote sensing; wetland; Amazon Basin; South America",,,,,,,,,,,,"Melack, J.M.; Bren Sch. of Environ.

We established chronosequences of large-area (14-158ha) selective logging sites spanning a 3.5-year period of forest regeneration and two distinct harvest methods: conventional logging (CL) and reduced-impact logging (RIL). Our goals were to: (1) determine the spatial characteristics of canopy gap fraction immediately following selective logging in the eastern Amazon; (2) determine the degree and rate of canopy closure in early years following harvest among the major landscape features associated with logging - tree falls, roads, skid trails and log decks; and (3) quantify spatial and temporal differences in canopy opening and closure in high- and low-damage harvests (CL vs. RIL). Across a wide range of harvest intensities (2.6-6.4 felled trees ha-1), the majority of ground damage occurred as skid trails (4-12%), whereas log decks and roads were only a small contributor to the total ground damage (&lt;2%). Despite similar timber harvest intensities, CL resulted in more ground damage than RIL. Neither the number of log decks nor their individual or total area was correlated with the number of trees removed or intensity of tree harvesting (trees ha-1). The area of skids was well correlated with the ground area damaged (m2) per tree felled. In recently logged forest (0.5 years postharvest), gap fractions were highest in log decks (mean RIL = 0.83, CL = 0.99) and lowest in tree-fall areas (RIL: 0.26, CL: 0.41). However, the small surface area of log decks made their contribution to the total area-integrated forest gap fraction minor. In contrast, tree falls accounted for more than two-thirds of the area disturbed, but the canopy gaps associated with felled trees were much smaller than for log decks, roads and skids. Canopy openings decreased in size with distance from each felled tree crown. At 0.5 years postharvest, the area initially affected by the felling of each tree was approximately 100 m in radius for CL and 50 m for RIL. Initial decreases in gap fraction during the first 1.5 years of regrowth diminished in subsequent years. Throughout the 3.5-year period of forest recovery, tree-fall gap fractions remained higher in CL than in RIL treatments, but canopy gap closure rates were higher in CL than in RIL areas. During the observed recovery period, the canopy gap area affected by harvesting decreased in radius around each felled tree from 100 to 40m in CL, and from 50 to 10 m in RIL. The results suggest that the full spatial and temporal dynamics of canopy gap fraction must be understood and monitored to predict the effects of selective logging on regional energy balance and climate regimes, biogeochemical processes including carbon cycling, and plant and faunal population dynamics. This paper also shows that remote sensing of log decks alone will not provide an accurate assessment of total forest area impacted by selective logging, nor will it be closely correlated to damage levels and canopy gap closure rates. © 2004 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","Amason basin; Brazil; Canopy damage; Carbon cycle; Forest recovery; Gap fraction; Selective logging; Tropical forest","canopy gap; forest management; gap dynamics; reforestation; selective logging; Amazon Basin; South America",,,,,,,,,,,,"Asner, G.P.; Department of Global Ecology, , Stanford, CA 94305, United States; email: gpa@stanford.edu",,,13541013,,,,"English","Global Change Biol.",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-2642538554

The extent and structural complexity of Amazon forests impedes ground studies of ecosystem functions such as net primary production (NPP), water cycling, and carbon sequestration. Traditional modeling and remote-sensing approaches are not well suited to tropical forest studies, because (i) biophysical mechanisms determining drought effects on canopy water and carbon dynamics are poorly known, and (ii) remote-sensing metrics of canopy greenness may be insensitive to small changes in leaf area accompanying drought. New spaceborne imaging spectroscopy may detect drought stress in tropical forests, helping to monitor forest physiology and constrain carbon models. We combined a forest drought experiment in Amazônia with spaceborne imaging spectrometer measurements of this area. With field data on rainfall, soil water, and leaf and canopy responses, we tested whether spaceborne hyperspectral observations quantify differences in canopy water and NPP resulting from drought stress. We found that hyperspectral metrics of canopy water content and light-use efficiency are highly sensitive to drought. Using these observations, forest NPP was estimated with greater sensitivity to drought conditions than with traditional combinations of modeling, remote-sensing, and field measurements. Spaceborne imaging spectroscopy will increase the accuracy of ecological studies in humid tropical forests.","Carbon cycle; Rainforest; Remote sensing; Tropical","carbon; rain; soil water; article; canopy; drought stress; experiment; forest; forest dynamics; light; measurement; model; nonhuman; plant leaf; plant water content; priority journal; quantitative analysis; remote sensing; spectroscopy; Brazil; Carbon; Spectrum Analysis; Trees; Water",,,,,,,,,,,,"Asner, G.P.; Department of Global Ecology, 260 Panama Street, Stanford, CA 9430S, United States; email: gpa@stanford.edu",,,00278424,,PNASA,"15071182","English","Proc.

However, their presence in a tree crown may be a source of confusion in remotely sensed data collected for inventories or assessment of vegetation health. The structural growth form of lianas contrasts with trees in that their proportion of leafy biomass to woody biomass is much higher. In effect, they use trees for structural support and typically form a monolayer of leaves above the crown of the supporting tree. Here, we investigated possible differences between hyperspectral signatures of lianas and trees at the leaf level using pattern recognition techniques. Our method involves principal components analysis followed by training and classification using a selection of supervised parametric and nonparametric classifiers. At a tropical dry forest site (Parque Natural Metropolitano), lianas and trees are distinguishable as groups based on their leaf spectral reflectance characteristics in dry season conditions. Classification was improved using ancillary data on leaf chlorophyll content. Their distinction at this site may be related to drought stress and/or phenological differences between the two groups. At a tropical wet forest site (Fort Sherman), discrimination between the two groups was not as clear. Additional research is required to determine the physiological basis of possible differences as well as to determine if these differences are observable at the canopy level. © 2004 Elsevier Inc.

This paper calculates the power and interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) sensitivity to tree height and vegetation density as it manifests in extinction, using a homogeneous, random-volume model of the forest medium, and accounting for speckle and thermal noise. Tree height and extinction are both related to biomass within the context of this simple model. Signal and noise calculations show that InSAR coherence and phase are more sensitive than radar power to structure and biomass to 10% variations in structure parameters over a wide range of medium to high density forests. For example, for extinctions of 0.2 db m-1 and other parameters as noted in the text, the sensitivity of InSAR coherence to 10% changes in tree height exceeds observation errors for trees shorter than about 37 m, as opposed to 14 m for radar power. InSAR phase sensitivity to 10% structural and associated biomass changes exceeds observation errors for all tree heights. Only for the very lowest densities, for extinctions less than 0.15 db m-1, does radar power sensitivity to density exceed that of InSAR; even at low densities, InSAR sensitivity to tree height outperforms that of radar power in these calculations.",,"Calculations; Estimation; Interferometry; Mathematical models; Random processes; Synthetic aperture radar; Thermal noise; Vegetation; Interferometric synthetic aperture radar; Random volume model; Tree height; Vegetation density; Remote sensing",,,,,,,,,,,,"Treuhaft, R.N.; Jet Propulsion Laboratory, 4800 Oak Grove Drive, MS 138-212, Pasadena, CA 91109, United States; email: Robert.Treuhaft@jpl.nasa.gov",,,09597174,,WRMEE,,"English","Waves Random Media",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-1942436853

We focused on within- and across-biome variance in long-term average gNDVI, emphasizing the degree to which this variance is explained by spatial gradients in long-term average seasonal climate. Since direct measurements of ecosystem function are unavailable at the spatial and temporal scales studied, we used the satellite-based gNDVI as a proxy for net photosynthetic activity. Forested and nonforested biomes differed sharply in their response to spatial gradients in temperature and precipitation. Gradients in mean spring and fall precipitation totals explained much of the variance in mean annual gNDVI within arid biomes. For forested biomes, mean annual gNDVI was positively associated with mean annual and seasonal Tmin and Tmax. These trends highlight the importance of the seasonal components of precipitation and temperature regimes in controlling productivity, and reflect the influence of these climatic components on water balance and growing-season length. According to the International Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) (2001) increases in temperature minima and fall precipitation have contributed the dominant components of US increases in temperature and precipitation, respectively. Within the range of conditions observed over the study region, our results suggest that these trends have particularly significant consequences for above-ground plant productivity, especially for Grassland, Open Shrubland, and Evergreen Needleleaf Forest. If historical climatic trends and the biotic responses suggested in this analysis continue to hold, we can anticipate further increases in productivity for both forested and nonforested ecoregions in the conterminous US, with associated implications for carbon budgets and woody proliferation. © 2004 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","Biome; Climate; Plant-productivity; Remote sensing; Seasonality; United States","climate change; NDVI; photosynthesis; precipitation (climatology); seasonality; spatial variation; temperature",,,,,,,,,,,,"Moody, A.; Department of Geography, , Chapel Hill, NC 27599-3220, United States; email: aaronm@email.unc.edu",,,13541013,,,,"English","Global Change Biol.",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-16544392321

Accuracy assessment is particularly problematic when thematic classes lie along a land-cover continuum, and boundaries between classes are ambiguous. In this study, we examined error sources introduced during accuracy assessment of a regional land-cover map generated from Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) data in Rondônia, southwestern Brazil. In this dynamic, highly fragmented landscape, the dominant land-cover classes represent a continuum from pasture to second growth to primary forest. We used high spatial resolution, geocoded videography as a reference, and focused on second-growth forest because of its potential contribution to the regional carbon balance. To quantify subjectivity in reference data labeling, we compared reference data produced by five trained interpreters. We also quantified the impact of other error sources, including geolocation errors between the map and reference data, land-cover changes between dates of data collection, heterogeneous reference samples, and edge pixels. Interpreters disagreed on classification of almost 30% of the samples; mixed reference samples and samples located in transitional classes accounted for a majority of disagreements. Agreement on second-growth forest labels between any two interpreters averaged below 50%, while agreement on primary forest was over 90%. Greater than 30% of disagreement between map and reference data was attributed to geolocation error, and 2.4% of disagreement was attributed to change in land cover between dates. After geocorrection, 24% of remaining disagreements corresponded to reference samples with mixed land cover, and 47% corresponded to edge pixels on the classified map. These findings suggest that: (1) labels of continuous land-cover types are more subjective and variable than commonly assumed, especially for transitional classes; however, using multiple interpreters to produce the reference data classification increases reference data accuracy; and (2) validation data sets that include only non-mixed, non-edge samples are likely to result in overly optimistic accuracy estimates, not representative of the map as a whole. These results suggest that different regional estimates of second-growth extent may be inaccurate and difficult to compare. © 2004 Elsevier Inc.

For this purpose, Hyperion, ALI, IKONOS, and ETM+ data were acquired for southern Cameroon, a region considered to be a representative area for tropical moist evergreen and semi-deciduous forests. Field data, collected in near-real time to coincide with satellite sensor overpass, were used to (1) quantify and model the biomass of tree, shrub, and weed species; and (2) characterize forest land use/land cover (LULC) classes. The study established that even the most advanced broadband sensors (i.e., ETM+, IKONOS, and ALI) had serious limitations in modeling biomass and in classifying forest LULC classes. The broadband models explained only 13-60% of the variability in biomass across primary forests, secondary forests, and fallows. The overall accuracies were between 42% and 51% for classifying nine complex rainforest LULC classes using the broadband data of these sensors. Within individual vegetation types (e.g., primary or secondary forest), the overall accuracies increased slightly, but followed a similar trend. Among the broadband sensors, ALI sensor performed better than the IKONOS and ETM+ sensors. When compared to the three broadband sensors, Hyperion narrowband data produced (1) models that explained 36-83% more of the variability in rainforest biomass, and (2) LULC classifications with 45-52% higher overall accuracies. Twenty-three Hyperion narrowbands that were most sensitive in modeling forest biomass and in classifying forest LULC classes were identified and discussed. © 2004 Elsevier Inc.

However, very little is known about the biomass and LAI of the vegetation in the Scandinavian mountain area. In this study, extensive field data consisting of diameter at breast height for 13 000 trees and height for 550 trees were collected. Furthermore, biomass and leaf area (LA) measurements for 46 mountain birch trees [Betula pubescens ssp. czerepanovii (Orlowa) Hämet-Ahti] and biomass and LA measurements for shrubs (e.g. Salix spp., Betula nana) at 36 sample plots were carried out. Multiplicative linear models for trees were fitted to tree biomass and LA measurements using basal area at breast height, height, crown diameter and diameter at stump height as explanatory variables. Additive linear models were fitted to shrub biomass and LAI measurements using coverage of shrubs, topographic variables and soil type as explanatory variables. The functions were then used to predict the biomass and LAI for trees and shrubs for the entire test area, which covers an area of 84 km2 and is located at latitude 68° N. The mean total biomass estimates were 27 493 kg ha-1 for the forest and 7650 kg ha-1 for snow-protected heath and meadow vegetation. The LAIs were 2.06 and 0.52, respectively. For monitoring biomass and LAI in the Scandinavian mountain area, the functions could also be applied to data from traditional field-based inventories and the estimates might further be improved by combining the estimates from the test area with auxiliary information such as remote sensing images.","Abisko; Allometric relationship; Betula pubescens ssp. czerepanovii; Ground vegetation; Mountain birch; Shrub layer","Biomass; Climatology; Ecology; Plants (botany); Snow; Vegetation; Climate models; Forestry; Betula; Betula nana; Betula pubescens subsp. tortuosa; Salix","European Commission, EC","This study was part of the research programme Climate Impacts Research Centre and was funded partly by EU structural funds and partly by regional funds.

In this paper, we develop a new, satellite-based Vegetation Photosynthesis Model (VPM) to estimate the seasonal dynamics and interannual variation of GPP of evergreen needleleaf forests. The VPM model uses two improved vegetation indices (Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI), Land Surface Water Index (LSWI)). We used multi-year (1998-2001) images from the VEGETATION sensor onboard the SPOT-4 satellite and CO2 flux data from a CO2 eddy flux tower site in Howland, Maine, USA. The seasonal dynamics of GPP predicted by the VPM model agreed well with observed GPP in 1998-2001 at the Howland Forest. These results demonstrate the potential of the satellite-driven VPM model for scaling-up GPP of forests at the CO2 flux tower sites, a key component for the study of the carbon cycle at regional and global scales. © 2003 Elsevier Inc.

In the present study a simple PAR estimation model was developed for Southeast Asia, where large-scale forest fires occurred during El Niño years. The model considered the smoke aerosol released by forest fires using satellite-based smoke detection methods. A comparison study with ground-based solar radiation data for Malaysia and Thailand indicated that the current model could estimate monthly PAR with 10% (root-mean-square) accuracy and would successfully trace the seasonal and year-to-year variations in PAR, including the forest fire periods. During the peak-smoke month in Indonesia, September 1997, the reduction of PAR by smoke reached 63-75% in the center of the Kalimantan and Sumatra Islands. From the analyses of the smoke and cloud cover impacts on PAR in 1997-1999, annual PAR variations were found to be mostly regulated by smoke variations on the Malay Peninsula, Sumatra, and Kalimantan Islands and cloud cover variations on the Indo-China Peninsula. Thus annual variations in PAR changed with location. These variations did not simply correlate with year-to-year variations in cloud cover associated with the El Niño and La Niña cycle, but exhibited more complicated spatial variations due to the existence of smoke in Southeast Asia.

However, the potential effects of complex topography on this measurement system are not well understood. Our objective was to understand how complex terrain and measurement aggregation influence the relationship between LAI and remotely sensed vegetation indices across a mountainous conifer forest. We identified NDVIc, a middle-infrared (MIR) correction to NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index), as the vegetation index providing the best prediction of effective plant area index (PAIe), used to approximate LAI. We tested formal hypotheses to identify how elevation and solar insolation gradients and spatial scale of measurement aggregation affected the PAIe-NDVIc relationship and found that it changed across elevation at one spatial scale. Comparisons of NDVIc with NDVI revealed that vegetation index choice is important in complex terrain, and we concluded that the MIR correction improves the PAI e-NDVI relationship by explaining variation related to solar insolation. Our results suggest that NDVIc calculated from Landsat ETM+ provides a practical estimate of PAIe across our northern Idaho study area and potentially other conifer forests in complex terrain.",,"Carbon; Error correction; Geostationary satellites; Image sensors; Photosynthesis; Remote sensing; Vegetation; Carbon sequestration; Plant area measurements; Plants (botany); accuracy assessment; complex terrain; elevation; forest ecosystem; insolation; Landsat thematic mapper; leaf area index; NDVI; remote sensing; topographic effect; Idaho; North America; United States; Coniferophyta",,,,,,,,,,,,"Pocewicz, A.L.; Department of Forest Resources, , Moscow, ID 83844-1133, United States; email: poce6886@uidaho.edu",,,00455067,,CJFRA,,"English","Can.

We mapped forest cover in Kalimantan, Indonesia, in 2002, with imagery provided by the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MODIS). The MODIS-based forest and nonforest map showed good agreement with other sources of recent data on forest cover. Comparison of MODIS forest cover with Indonesian government data from 1996 revealed that almost 3 million ha of forest were lost in Kalimantan since the major El Niño event of 1997-1998, when a drought produced unprecedented biomass burning in the region. Over two-thirds of the deforestation occurred in proposed and existing protected areas, especially those of 100,000-250,000 ha. The loss of forest in proposed and existing protected areas suggests that Kalimantan's protected-area network is no longer viable and that alternative conservation strategies, such as timber certification and improved monitoring and enforcement, are needed to preserve remaining forest habitats there.",,"deforestation; El Nino; forest cover; protected area; remote sensing; Asia; Eurasia; Indonesia; Kalimantan; Southeast Asia",,,,,,,,,,,,"Fuller, D.O.; Dept. of Geogr. and Regional Studies, , Coral Gables, FL 33124, United States; email: dofuller@miami.edu",,,08888892,,CBIOE,,"English","Conserv.

In the initial phase of this study (early 1990s), remote sensing played a key role by providing products needed for planning and modeling. During and after the main BOREAS field campaigns (1994 and 1996), innovative remote sensing approaches and analyses expanded our understanding of the boreal forest in four key areas: (1) definition of vegetation structure, (2) land-cover classification, (3) assessment of the carbon balance, and (4) links between surface properties, weather, and climate. In addition to six BOREAS special issues and over 500 journal papers, a principal legacy of BOREAS is its well-documented and publicly available database, which provides a lasting scientific resource and opportunity to further advance our understanding of this critical northern biome. © 2003 Elsevier Inc.

This has led to the Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) mission, a European Space Agency (ESA) Earth Explorer Opportunity mission. SMOS has the objective to observe soil moisture over land and sea surface salinity over sea, both key parameters for atmospheric, oceanographic and hydrological predictive models. In preparation of SMOS, the EuroSTARRS airborne campaign was carried out in November 2001. Multi-angular measurements of the surface brightness temperature at L-band (1.4 GHz) at vertical polarization were acquired by the 'Salinity Temperature and Roughness Remote Scanner' (STARRS) radiometer from the Naval Research Laboratory (NRL, USA) over several sites in Southern France, the Pyrenees and Eastern Spain. The chosen sites represent specific land conditions and vegetation canopies where microwave surface emission models need further investigation, and include: dense forests, shrubs and scrubland, mixed areas of different vegetation covers and areas with variable topography. This paper gives an overview of the experiment, including a discussion of the objectives, description of the sites, details of the microwave measurements and some first results of the campaign. First, a principal component analysis of the forest brightness temperature measured at different configurations illustrates the sensitivity of brightness temperature to biomass conditions for coniferous trees. Then, the microwave signature of the vegetation covers considered in this study-coniferous forest at Les Landes (France), mixed deciduous/coniferous stands at the Agre forest (France), shrubland, vineyards and orchards at the Valencia site (Spain)-is illustrated, in particular as regards to the dependence of the L-band emissivity to biomass conditions.",,"Microwaves; Moisture; Radiometry; Remote sensing; Salinity measurement; Surface properties; Vegetation; Land surfaces; Surface-brightness temperature; Soils; airborne sensing; brightness temperature; land cover; microwave imagery; radiometer; remote sensing; soil moisture; Comunidad Valencia; Eurasia; Europe; France; Pyrenees; Southern Europe; Spain; Western Europe","Scioto Foundation; Center for Neuroscience and Regenerative Medicine; Institut National de la Recherche Agronomique","This work has been carried out in the framework of the respective ESTEC-ESA n‡ 15949/02/NL/SF Contracts with Universitat de Valencia (Spain), INRA (Bordeaux, France) and CNRM (Toulouse, France).

Natural and anthropogenic disturbances have important and lasting influences on ecosystem structure and fluxes that can be difficult to detect or assess with conventional methods. In this study, we combined two recent advances in remote sensing and ecosystem modeling to improve model carbon stock and flux estimates at a tropical forest study site at La Selva, Costa Rica (10°25′ N, 84°00′ W). Airborne lidar remote sensing was used to measure spatial heterogeneity in the vertical structure of vegetation. The ecosystem demography model (ED) was used to estimate the consequences of this heterogeneity for regional estimates of carbon stocks and fluxes. Lidar data provided substantial constraints on model estimates of both carbon stocks and net carbon fluxes. Lidar-initialized ED estimates of aboveground biomass were within 1.2% of regression-based approaches, and corresponding model estimates of net carbon fluxes differed substantially from bracketing alternatives. The results of this study provide a promising illustration of the power of combining lidar data on vegetation height with a height-structured ecosystem model. Extending these analyses to larger scales will require the development of regional and global lidar data sets, and the continued development and application of height structured ecosystem models.","Aboveground biomass; Carbon fluxes; Costa Rica; Ecosystem demography; Ecosystem modeling; La Selva; Lidar; Regional carbon stocks; Remote sensing","carbon flux; carbon sequestration; ecosystem modeling; lidar; remote sensing; vegetation structure; Central America; Costa Rica; Heredia; La Selva; Western Hemisphere; World",,,,,,,,,,,,"Hurtt, G.C.; Inst.

Furthermore, the first in situ airborne measurements of sensible heat and carbon fluxes in fire plumes were combined with remote measurements of flame properties to provide consistent remote-sensing-based estimators of these fluxes. These estimators provide a means to determine rates of fuel consumption and carbon emission to the atmosphere by wildland fires as required for assessments of fire impacts on regional air pollution or global emissions of greenhouse gases. Observed fires developed complex fire-line geometry and thermal structure, even as average whole-fire temperatures varied little. Flame temperatures sometimes exceeded 1600 K along the leading edge of actively spreading fire lines, yet &gt;90% of the radiant energy from observed fires was associated with temperatures of 830-1440 K. Fire in a partially slashed forest encompassed a high-intensity flaming front and a trailing reach of residual combustion extending 400 m. Fire fronts in tropical savanna typically formed with little depth and a high proportion of their radiant flux density associated with high temperatures due to low levels of residual combustion. Measured fires had such low and variable radiance compared with that of a blackbody of comparable temperature as to preclude the use of fire radiance at a single wavelength as a measure of fire intensity or temperature. One-half of the radiant flux density from a measured savanna fire was associated with values of a combined emissivity-fractional-area parameter &lt;0.091 m2/m2; for a slash fire this fraction was associated with values &lt;0.37 m2/m2.

The research goals were to map snow avalanche paths and to characterize vegetation patterns in selected paths for longitudinal (i.e., source, track, and runout) and transverse (i.e., inner, flanking, outer) zones as part of a study of forest dynamics and nutrient flux from paths into terrestrial and aquatic systems. In some valleys, as much as 50 percent of the area may be covered by snow avalanche paths, and as such, serve as an important carbon source servicing terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems. Snow avalanches move woody debris down-slope by snapping, tipping, trimming, and excavating branches, limbs, and trees, and by injuring and scaring trees that remain in-place. Further, snow avalanches alter the vegetation structure on paths through secondary plant succession of disturbed areas. Contrast and edge enhancements, Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), and the Tasseled Cap greenness and wetness transformations were used to examine vegetation patterns in selected paths that were affected by high magnitude snow avalanches during the winter of 2001-2002. Using image transects organized in longitudinal patterns in paths and in forests, and transects arranged in transverse patterns across the sampled paths, the Tasseled Cap transforms (and NDVI values) were plotted and assessed. Preliminary results suggest that NDVI patterns are different for paths and forests, and Tasseled Cap greenness and wetness patterns are different for longitudinal and transverse zones that describe the morphology of snow avalanche paths. The differentiation of paths from the background forest and the characterization of paths by morphometric zones through remote sensing has implications for mapping forest disturbances and dynamics over time and for large geographic areas and for modeling nutrient flux in terrestrial and aquatic systems.","Digital enhancements; Glacier National Park; Ikonos imagery; Montana; Snow avalanche paths",,"National Science Foundation, NSF: 0234018","Funding for work described in this paper has been provided by a National Science Foundation Small Grant for Exploratory Research (G.P.

The study areas, ranging in size from 600 to 10 000 km2, include communities that practice a range of land uses from small-scale, rotational agriculture to long-term pasture. Carbon emissions from deforestation were estimated based on rates of deforestation derived from Landsat satellite data and published estimates of mature forest biomass. Estimates of carbon uptake by secondary forest regrowth were based on area estimates from the satellite data and biomass estimates from field surveys. Estimates of carbon emissions from the clearance of secondary forest were included. The total carbon emissions were partitioned into that immediately released by biomass burning during clearance and that from subsequent decomposition and burning of felled biomass. A range of net carbon fluxes from secondary forest regrowth and clearance was estimated by extrapolating land-use patterns in each study area to the entire area of deforested landscape in Amazonian Brazil and Bolivia, and by varying average biomass accumulation rate of regrowing forest and fallow period. Over 60 km 2 of forest were cleared from 1988 to 1995 in each of the Brazilian study areas, and over 940 km2 were cleared from 1986 to 1996 in the Bolivian study area. This resulted in 30-200 Mg C/yr emitted from biomass burning during deforestation. If the carbon that is committed to subsequent burning and decomposition of felled biomass is included, total committed emissions of 75-650 Mg C/yr resulted from deforestation in each study area. The carbon uptake by secondary forests was 33-435 Mg C/yr. However, emissions from the reclearance of secondary forests were nearly as large: 17-365 Mg C/yr. Extrapolation of these results to the Brazilian and Bolivian Amazon suggests that, at the national level, carbon uptake by secondary forests offset less than one-fifth of the carbon emissions from deforestation. Despite differences in land-use pattern, average fallow period, and rate of biomass accumulation used in the extrapolation, net carbon uptake by secondary forests was consistently small when compared to the total emissions from deforestation.","Biomass; Bolivia; Brazil; Land use; Landsat satellite; Regrowth; Secondary forest","carbon flux; deforestation; land use change; Landsat; regrowth; remote sensing; secondary forest; Amazonia; South America",,,,,,,,,,,,"Steininger, M.K.; Lab. for Terrestrial Phys., , Greenbelt, MD 20771, United States; email: marc@surutu.gsfc.nasa.gov",,"Ecological Society of America",10510761,,ECAPE,,"English","Ecol.

These sites were set up initially for the validation of satellite data obtained from MODIS station established for the project ""Asia-Pacific Environmental Innovation Strategy (APEIS)"", which was launched in 2001 by the Ministry of the Environment of Japan, so we called them APEIS-FLUX system. The main objective of this study was to validate estimates of surface temperature, evaporation, soil moisture, as well as leaf area index and net primary productivity (NPP) generated by MODIS satellite data, and to understand the mechanisms controlling the exchanges of energy, water vapor and CO2 across a spectrum of time and space scales. The results show that both latent flux and CO2 flux are much higher in the crop field than those in the grassland and the saline desert, but the sensible heat flux is in the opposite way. Using the observed data to validate the MODIS data products, we found that different products have very different correspondence, which suggests that the algorithm to be used to process MODIS products needs to be revised by using the local dataset.

A time series of Japanese Earth Resource Satellite-1 (JERS-1) L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data was employed to monitor two dynamic ecosystem processes; deforestation and inundation patterns. Using a change detection analysis for three images acquired during dry seasons of 1994, 1997 and 1998, we detected the deforestation that has occurred in the region due to the anthropogenic and natural causes. At a threshold of ± dB change in backscattering response, an area of about 98 km2 of these forests was found to have been cleared during 1994-1997 for conversion to cultivatable lands. However, the agricultural crops miserably failed to grow on these cleared lands because of the adverse water and soil chemistry conditions. The deliberate draining of these lands, by laying and extension of a huge network of canals, created congenial ecological conditions for the spread of forest fires, particularly during the 1997 El Niño period. An area of 250 km2 of forests was thus detected to have been destroyed by these fires between September 1997 and January 1998. These deforested lands are rapidly regenerating since their abandonment and the regenerating carbon stocks were simulated using the CENTURY ecosystem dynamics model. Furthermore, the L-band SAR was able to detect the pixel-wise seasonal and spatial inundation information for particular forest types where the transmissivity of the L-band SAR signals was quite significant. These forest types corresponded to comparatively low biomass areas. The SAR derived information about these two important dynamic processes would be useful for improving the accuracy of modelling the spatial and temporal distribution of the carbon and other trace gases in these ecosystems. © Springer-Verlag 2003.","Backscattering coefficient; Deforestation; Ecosystem dynamics; Inundation; Peatland forests; Regeneration and synthetic aperture radar (SAR)","biogeochemical cycle; deforestation; ecosystem dynamics; environmental monitoring; image analysis; peatland; remote sensing; soil carbon; synthetic aperture radar",,,,,,,,,,,,"Romshoo, S.A.; Earth Observation Research Center (EORC), 1-8-10 Harumi Island, Chuo-ku, Tokyo 104-6023, Japan; email: shakil@eorc.nasda.go.jp",,,16102924,,,,"English","Vis.

We used a multi-scale methodology to link field inventory data reported at plot and forestry district levels through a remotely sensed total plant biomass map derived from 1-km 2 AVHRR image. Total litter fall was estimated as function of elevation and latitude. Leaf litter fall, a surrogate for fine root production, was estimated from total litter fall by forest type. The gridded NPP estimates agreed well with previously reported NPP values, based on point measurements. Regional NPP increases from northeast to southwest. It is positively related to annual mean temperature and annual mean total precipitation (strongly correlated with temperature) and is negatively related to elevation at broad scale. Total NPP (TNPP) values for representative cells selected based on three criteria were highly correlated with simulated values from a process-based model (CEVSA) at 0.5° x 0.5° resolution. At 1-km2 resolution, mean above-ground NPP in the region was 408 g/m2/yr ranging from 172 to 1091 (standard deviation (SD) = 134). Mean TNPP was 563 (252 to 1426, SD = 176). Ranges and SD were reduced while the mean values of the estimated NPP stayed almost constant as cell size increased from 1-km2 to 0.5° x 0.5°, as expected.

The objective of this research was to compare change detection techniques for identifying deforestation and cattle pasture formation during a period of early colonization and agricultural expansion in the vicinity of Jamari, Rondônia. Multi-date Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) data between 1984 and 1992 were examined in a 94 370 ha area of active deforestation to map land cover change. The tasselled cap (TC) transformation was used to enhance the contrast between forest, cleared areas and regrowth. TC images were stacked into a composite multi-date TC and used in a principal components (PC) transformation to identify change components. In addition, consecutive TC image pairs were differenced and stacked into a composite multi-date differenced image. A maximum likelihood classification of each image composite was compared for identification of land cover change. The multi-date TC composite classification had the best accuracy of 0.78 (kappa). By 1984, only 5% of the study area had been cleared, but by 1992, 11% of the area had been deforested, primarily for pasture, and 7% lost due to hydroelectric dam flooding. Finally, discrimination of pasture versus cultivation was improved due to the ability to detect land under sustained clearing opposed to land exhibiting regrowth with infrequent clearing. © 2004 Taylor & Francis Ltd.",,"Cultivation; Deforestation; Floods; Image processing; Principal component analysis; Remote sensing; Change detection techniques; Land conversion; Land use; deforestation; detection method; forest fire; image analysis; land use change; Landsat thematic mapper; remote sensing; Brazil; Rondonia; South America","National Aeronautics and Space Administration, NASA","The authors would like to acknowledge funding for this research by the NASA Ames Graduate Students Researchers Program and data made available by the EROS Data Center DAAC.

When quantifying land-cover patterns from airborne or spaceborne sensors, the interconnectedness of fragmented landscapes may vary depending on the spatial resolution of the sensor and the extent at which the landscape is being observed. This scale dependence can significantly affect calculation of remote sensing vegetation indices, such as the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and its subsequent use to predict biophysical parameters such as the fraction of photosynthetically active radiation intercepted by forest canopies (fPAR). This means that simulated above-ground net primary productivity (NPPA) using canopy radiation interception models such as 3-PG (Physiological Principles for Predicting Growth), coupled with remote sensing observations, can yield different results in fragmented landscapes depending on the spatial resolution of the remotely sensed data.We compared the amount of forest fragmentation in 1 km SPOT-4 VEGETATION pixels using a simultaneously acquired 20 m SPOT-4 multispectral (XS) image. We then predicted NPPA for New Zealand native forest ecosystems using the 3-PG model with satellite-derived estimates of the fPAR obtained from the SPOT-4 VEGETATION sensor, using NDVI values with and without correction for fragmentation. We examined three methods to correct for sub-pixel fragmentation effects on NPPA. These included: (1) a simple conversion between the broad 1 km scale NDVI values and the XS NDVI values; (2) utilization of contextural information from XS NDVI pixels to derive a single coefficient to adjust the 1 km NDVI values; and (3) calculation of the degree of fragmentation within each VEGETATION 1 km pixel and reduce NDVI by an empirically derived amount based on the proportional areal coverage of forest in each pixel. Our results indicate that predicted NPPA derived from uncorrected 1 km VEGETATION pixels was significantly higher than estimates using adjusted NDVI values; all three methods reduced the predicted NPPA. In areas of the landscape with a large degree of forest fragmentation (such as forest boundaries) predictions of NPPA indicate that the fragmentation effect has implications for spatially extensive estimates of carbon uptake by forests. © 2004 Taylor & Francis Ltd.",,"Data reduction; Estimation; Imaging systems; Physiology; Remote sensing; Satellites; Vegetation; Forested landscapes; Vegetation indices; Forestry; forest ecosystem; image analysis; net primary production; pixel; remote sensing; satellite imagery; SPOT; vegetation index; Australasia; New Zealand",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,01431161,,,,"English","Int.

In this paper, an algorithm for the estimation of growing stock volume, an important parameter for the commercial forest community and a proxy for woody biomass density, from ERS and JERS synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data is described. The algorithm is based on the information content of both ERS tandem coherence and JERS backscatter images and was developed using ground data, made available by the Russian Forestry Services. It is tested on SAR datasets of boreal forests in Siberia, a managed, temperate forest plantation in the United Kingdom and a semi-natural boreal forest at Siggefora in Sweden. Comparisons of the classified products, comprising three growing stock interval classes and one non-forest class are made with ground data.

Lidar sensors have provided high-resolution data on forest height, canopy topography, volume, and gap size; and provided estimates on number of strata in a forest, successional status of forests, and above-ground biomass. Spectral sensors have provided data on vegetation types, foliar biochemistry content of forest canopies, tree and canopy phenology, and spectral signatures for selected tree species. A number of advances are theoretically possible with individual and combined spectral and lidar sensors for the study of forest structure, floristic composition and species richness. Delineating individual canopies of over-storey trees with small footprint lidar and discrimination of tree architectural types with waveform distributions is possible and would provide scientists with a new method to study tropical forest structure. Combined spectral and lidar data can be used to identify selected tree species and identify the successional status of tropical forest fragments in order to rank forest patches by levels of species richness. It should be possible in the near future to quantify selected patterns of tropical forests at a higher resolution than can currently be undertaken in the field or from space. © 2004 Taylor & Francis Ltd.",,"Biochemistry; Biodiversity; Biomass; Optical radar; Remote sensing; Sensors; Vegetation; Floristic composition; Forest canopies; Forestry; floristics; forest canopy; lidar; remote sensing; species richness; tropical forest; vegetation type",,,,,,,,,,,,"Gillespie, T.W.; Department of Geography, , Los Angeles, CA, 90095-1524, United States; email: tg@geog.ucla.edu",,,01431161,,,,"English","Int.

Most validation efforts in the literature are based on point measurements. Since landscapes in Belgium are quite heterogeneous, the spatial up-scaling of a point measurement to the level of a sensor pixel is a crucial issue. Process based models quite often have a large set of input variables, some of them hardly available or not measurable on a regional basis; on the other hand most of the process based models possess a prognostic capacity. The parametric C-Fix model estimates carbon mass fluxes from local, regional to continental scales. It ingests only a modest number of meteorological input variables, including satellite observations. Parametric models do not possess a prognostic capacity, but the spatial up-scaling by the use of remote sensing data is much more straightforward than with process models. In this paper, we describe the validation of C-Fix with eddy covariance NEP (net ecosystem production) measurements and further applied C-Fix for the mapping of the geographical distribution of carbon mass fluxes over the entire Belgian territory, using NOAA-AVHRR (1997) and SPOT4-VGT imagery (April 1998–March 1999). We combine a forest probability map, derived from NOAA data for 1997 with the mapped estimates of Belgian NEP to obtain forest NEP per image pixel. Forest NEP is validated regionally, with measurements of carbon exchange obtained at two Belgian Euroflux eddy covariance tower sites (the Brasschaat, ‘Inslag’ and Vielsalm, ‘Tinseubois’ forest sites). A correlation analysis is performed for the estimated forest NEPs at both Euroflux sites and the NEP measured there, assumed to be primarily from forest. Finally, a correlation analysis with a process-based stand scale model (ASPECTS) is performed for the two forest sites, as a cross check on the validation results. Our results demonstrate that a parametric model, like C-Fix, provides a good basis to estimate the evolution and geographical distribution of the main constituents of the carbon budget of terrestrial ecosystems, in this study specifically forest ecosystems at the regional scale (Belgium). © 2004 Taylor & Francis Ltd.",,"Carbon; Ecosystems; Mathematical models; Sensors; Geographical distribution; Mass fluxes; Remote sensing; carbon flux; forest ecosystem; net ecosystem production; NOAA satellite; numerical model; remote sensing; SPOT; Belgium; Benelux; Eurasia; Europe; Western Europe",,,,,,,,,,,,"Veroustraete, F.; Flemish Institute for Technological Research (Vito), Boeretang, Mol, B-2400, Belgium; email: frank.veroustraete@vito.be",,,01431161,,,,"English","Int.

In 1999 the IKONOS satellite began offering worldwide 1-m panchromatic and 4-m multispectral data. Here we show that these data can be used to address diverse aspects of forest ecology and land-use classification in the tropics. Using crowns of emergent trees as control points, we georeferenced a 600-ha subset of IKONOS 1-m and 4-m data from an August 2000 image of the La Selva Biological Station, Costa Rica (root mean square error = 4.3 m). Crown area measured on the image was highly correlated with crown area for the same tree measured from the ground. Using a 1988 aerial photograph as a baseline, all trees &gt;1 m diameter in a long-term study that died over the ensuing 12-year period, and that could be located in the photograph, were detected as missing in the IKONOS image (N = 7). Crown growth for large trees visible on both images averaged 12 m2/yr (N = 16). We thus demonstrate that IKONOS imagery can provide data on four variables necessary for doing demographic research: tree size, location, mortality, and growth. Stand basal area, estimated aboveground biomass, and percentage of the canopy &gt;15 m tall for 18 0.5-ha permanent forest inventory plots in old growth were all highly significantly correlated with different indices derived from the IKONOS data. We used summary statistics from the original IKONOS data as well as derived indices to characterize nine areas with well-documented land-use histories. Secondary forests were clearly separable from the other sites. One of the secondary forests was 40 years old, suggesting that IKONOS data can be used to detect significantly older secondary forest than is possible with coarser resolution satellite data. The selectively logged forest was distinguishable by measuring the size of the largest crowns on the 1-m image. This suggests a range of applications for detecting and quantifying biomass degradation due to selective logging and edge effects. Satellite data at 1-m and 4-m resolution make possible a truly global approach to fine spatial resolution remote-sensing studies of TRF ecology and land use.","Costa Rica; Fine spatial resolution data; Forest biomass; High-resolution satellite data; IKONOS; QuickBird; Remote sensing; Selective logging; Tropical land use; Tropical rain forest; Tropical secondary forests","deforestation; ecosystem management; environmental monitoring; rainforest; satellite imagery; tropical environment",,,,,,,,,,,,"Clark, D.B.O.T.S.

The approach developed to meet this requirement is a hybrid between GIS-based process modelling and empiricism. Multi-temporal mapping of productivity was carried out using a variant of the 3PG (physiological principles predicting growth) model. Relationships were found between mapped productivity indices and measurements of biomass at maturity (i.e. long-term- undisturbed stands). This information was then used to interpolate maps of biomass potential. Simple growth formulae were used to plot biomass accumulation, with the ‘rate of approach to mature biomass’ set by the age at which maximum current annual increment occurs and the predicted site plant productivity over time. The age of the forest stand was determined from disturbance events detected by twelve national coverages of Landsat MSS, TM and ETM+ remotely-sensed data collected between 1972 and 2002. Responses to thinning of existing forests are calculated using an adjustment of stand age concurrent with the intensity of the thinning event. © 2004 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Accounting; Area; Australia; Carbon; Carbon sequestration; Forest management; Growth rate; Increment; Inventories; Models; Productivity; Remote sensing; Thinning","Carbon; Climate change; Forestry; Growth (materials); Interpolation; Productivity; Project management; Remote sensing; Carbon sequestration; Error distribution; Genetic improvement; Thining; Inventory control; Australia; Carbon; Forestry; Growth; Inventory Control; Planning; Productivity; Remote Sensing",,,,,,,,,,,,"Richards, G.P.; National Carbon Accounting System, GPO Box 621, Canberra, ACT, 2601, Australia; email: gary.richards @ greenhouse.gov.au",,,00049158,,,,"English","Aust Forest",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-11144236819

Maps of land cover, leaf area index, and biomass of this forested region are first derived from ETM+ data. With these maps and additional soil texture and daily meteorological data, NPP and ET maps are produced for 2001 using the boreal ecosystem productivity simulator (BEPS). The results show that the estimated and observed NPP values for forest agree fairly well, with a mean relative error of 8.6%. The NPP of mixed forests is the highest, with a mean of 500 g C m–2·a–1, and that of alpine tundra and shrub is the lowest, with a mean of 136 g C m–2·a–1. Unlike the spatial pattern of NPP, the annual ET changes distinctly with altitude from greater than 600 mm at the foot of the mountain to about 200 mm at the top of the mountain.

Disturbing factors such as forest structural differences - and, notably, at low biomass levels, terrain roughness, and soil moisture variation - cause further complications. A new and indirect inversion approach is proposed that may circumvent such problems. Using multifrequency polarimetric radar the forest structure can be assessed accurately. Ecological relationships link these structures with biomass levels, even for high biomass levels. The LIFEFORM model is introduced as a new approach to transform field observations of the complex tropical forest into input files for the theoretical UTARTCAN polarimetric backscatter model. The validity of UTARTCAN for a wide range of forest structures is shown. Backscatter simulations for a wide range of forest structures, terrain roughness, and soil moisture clearly show the limitations of the direct approach and the validity of the proposed indirect approach up to very high levels of biomass.","Biomass; Polarimetric radar; Theoretical backscatter model; Tropical forest","Backscattering; Biomass; Polarimeters; Remote sensing; Soil surveys; Biomass estimation; Polarimetric radar; Radar imaging",,,,,,,,,,,,"Quiñones, M.J.; Subdepartment of Water Resources, , 6709 PA, Wageningen, Netherlands; email: Marcela.Quinones@wur.nl",,,01962892,,IGRSD,,"English","IEEE Trans Geosci Remote Sens",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-10744229994

The daily model was run under a variety of assumptions and the results emphasize the need in future analyses: (1) to focus on time-dependent seasonal changes in canopy physiology as well as in leaf area index, (2) to compare time courses of physiological change in different habitats in terms of recognizable cardinal points in the seasonal course, and (3) to develop methods for utilizing information on seasonal changes in physiology in regional and continental carbon budget simulations. The results suggest that the daily model with appropriate seasonal adjustments for physiological process regulation should be an efficient tool for use in conjunction with remote sensing for regional evaluation of global change scenarios.","Canopy gas exchange; Ecosystem physiology; Forest ecosystems; Primary production; Temporal scaling","coniferous forest; deciduous forest; ecophysiology; ecosystem modeling; gas exchange; global change; primary production; respiration; temperate forest; Chen; Fagus; Picea",,,,,,,,,,,,"Tenhunen, J.; Department of Plant Ecology, , Bayreuth 95440, Germany; email: john.tenhunen@uni-bayreuth.de",,,13541013,,,,"English","Global Change Biol.",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0842313041

Remote sensing and field transects reveal changes in forest carbon stocks and accumulation rates. Deforestation was most rapid along the Interoceanic Highway during 1986-91 when credit and guaranteed markets were available, resulting in emissions of 708,000 Mg C yr-1, of which 14% was offset by secondary regrowth. Despite continued population growth, deforestation slowed during 1991-97 when fiscal austerity measures were imposed, resulting in emissions of 389,000 Mg C yr-1, of which 41% was offset by regrowth.

The increment of aerosols by particles emanating from biomass burning affects solar radiation, mainly in the troposphere, by multiple scattering and interactions between molecule and aerosol scattering for several days after the fire. Among the topographic normalization methods, the Minnaert method assumes the anisotropic reflectance of surfaces by introducing the Minnaert constant, the value of which is affected by the atmospheric diffusion of light. In this paper, a methodology is developed in order to study atmospheric effects on this value. This is based on the optimum value of the Minnaert constant, which is the value that leads to the higher classification accuracy. The methodology has been tested on four Landsat TM and three SPOT XS images respectively. The optimum Minnaert value presented a high decrement (0.1-0.2 instead of 0.8-0.9) for two images. Both of them had been captured shortly after fires, without being visibly affected by smoke and atmospheric perturbation effects. The proposed methodology has successfully revealed fires through the Minnaert constant. This methodology has also revealed the quality of the image.

Tethersonde and lidar measurements were made at local midnight. The video camera operated continuously for 1 week. Estimates of mass concentration were derived from the light-scattering measurements. Every night, upper level smoke concentrations were estimated to be about 1000 times lower than near-surface concentrations. The tethersonde instrument indicated maximum mass concentrations on the night following the most active burning (10-11 July), with the smoke trapped below an inversion at 115 m AGL. The lidar measurements indicated that maximum mass concentrations aloft (∼2000 m AGL) occurred on the next night (11-12 July), when the inversion was weaker, and estimated mass concentrations in the first few hundred meters ASL were smaller. The opportunistic combination of instruments offers the first available quantitative information on vertical plume structure in smoldering biomass smoke and holds promise for more a rigorous understanding of smoldering smoke as it significantly impacts visibility and human health. © 2003 by the American Geophysical Union.","Biomass fire; Smoke particles","Biomass; fire; Smoke; biomass; boreal forest; fire; smoke; vertical distribution; Alaska; North America; United States",,,,,,,,,,,,"Ferguson, S.A.; Pacific Northwest Research Center, 400 North 34th Street, Seattle, WA 98103, United States; email: sferguson@fs.fed.us",,"Blackwell Publishing Ltd",01480227,,,,"English","J.

Autocorrelative and fractal properties were measured in this opportunistic study to quantify changes in canopy architecture along twelve, 190-250 m transects that were subjected to moderate to high levels of wind disturbance. Prior to the hurricane, canopy heights were autocorrelated at scales < 40 m with an average fractal dimension of 1.71. After the disturbance, autocorrelation disappeared; the average fractal dimension rose to 1.94. This shift towards spatial randomness illustrates part of the cyclical nature of ecosystem development. It shows how a catastrophic collapse of biomass accumulation corresponds to a decrease in ecosystem organization across a landscape.","Autocorrelation; Canopy topography; Disturbance; Duke Forest; Ecosystem organisation; Forest landscape; Fractal dimension; Hurricane; Laser altimetry; Remote sensing","canopy architecture; disturbance; hurricane; landscape ecology; laser method; remote sensing; spatial analysis; stand structure; North America; North Carolina; United States","National Science Foundation, NSF: DEB-9984574","We thank David Harding at the Laser Altimeter Processing Facility at NASA GSFC for the laser profiling data; Wendy Weiher from the Duke Forest for GIS data layers and logistical support; Jason Drake, Jason Godin, and Jon Sloan for field assistance; Peter Har-rell for loblolly plantation height measurements; and Jack Stout and Hank Whittier for reviews of earlier versions of the manuscript.

We studied a municipality in northeastern Pará, Brazil, that has been settled for over a century and where numerous cycles of slash and burn agriculture have occurred. The forests were grouped into young (3-6 years), intermediate (10-20 years), advanced (40-70 years), and mature successional stages using 1999 Landsat 7 ETM imagery. Supervised classification of the imagery showed that these forest classes occupied 22%, 13%, 9%, and 6% of the area, respectively. Although this area underwent widespread deforestation many decades ago, forest of some type covers about 50% of the area. Row crops, tree crops, and pastures cover 8%, 20%, and 22%, respectively. The best separation among land covers appeared in a plot of NDVI versus band 5 reflectance. The same groupings of successional forests were derived independently from indices of similarity among tree species composition. Measured distributions of tree height and diameter also covaried with these successional classes, with the young forests having nearly uniform distributions, whereas multiple height and diameter classes were present in the advanced successional forests. Biomass accumulated more slowly in this secondary forest chronosequence than has been reported for other areas, which explains why the 70-year-old forests here were still distinguishable from mature forests using spectral properties. Rates of forest regrowth may vary across regions due to differences in edaphic, climatic, and historical land-use factors, thus rendering most relationships among spectral properties and forest age site-specific. Successional status, as characterized by species composition, biomass, and distributions of heights and diameters, may be superior to stand age as a means of stratifying these forests for characterization of spectral properties. © 2003 Elsevier Inc.

Forest degradation field data, available in the literature, and 1-m resolution IKONOS image were linked with fraction images (vegetation, nonphotosynthetic vegetation (NPV), soil and shade) derived from spectral mixture models applied to a Satellite Pour L'observation de la Terre (SPOT) 4 multispectral image. The forest degradation map was produced in two steps. First, we investigated the relationship between ground (i.e., field and IKONOS data) and satellite scales by analyzing statistics and performing visual analyses of the field classes in terms of fraction values. This procedure allowed us to define four classes of forest at the SPOT 4 image scale, which included: intact forest; logged forest (recent and older logged forests in the field); degraded forest (heavily burned, heavily logged and burned forests in the field); and regeneration (old heavily logged and old heavily burned forest in the field). Next, we used a decision tree classifier (DTC) to define a set of rules to separate the forest classes using the fraction images. We classified 35% of the forest area (2097.3 km2) as intact forest. Logged forest accounted for 56% of the forest area and 9% of the forest area was classified as degraded forest. The resultant forest degradation map showed good agreement (86% overall accuracy) with areas of degraded forest visually interpreted from two IKONOS images. In addition, high correlation (R 2=0.97) was observed between the total live aboveground biomass of degraded forest classes (defined at the field scale) and the NPV fraction image. The NPV fraction also improved our ability to mapping of old selectively logged forests. © 2003 Published by Elsevier Inc.","Amazon; Fire; Forest degradation; Mixture models; Nonphotosynthetic vegetation; Selective logging","Biomass; Correlation methods; Degradation; Forestry; Statistics; Decision tree classifier (DTC); Remote sensing; deforestation; mapping; remote sensing; satellite imagery; selective logging; SPOT; Amazonia; South America; Nucleopolyhedrovirus","Brown University; Financiadora de Estudos e Projetos, FINEP; Ministério da Ciência e Tecnologia, MCT; Ministério do Meio Ambiente, MMA","The authors thank PPG7 “Programa de Pesquisa Dirigida” (MMA/MCT/FINEP) for the financial support to the Instituto do Homem e Meio Ambiente da Amazônia-IMAZON for conducting the forest inventory and acquiring the SPOT 4 and Landsat TM 5 images.

To ensure that different landscapes of ""Terra firme"" tropical forest of the Brazilian Amazon were represented, a test-site was selected in the lower Tapajós river region (Pará State). The microwave signals from the P-band polarimetric images were related to the aboveground biomass data by statistical regression models (logarithmic and polynomial functions). In the field survey, physiognomic and structural aspects of primary forest and regrowth were collected and afterwards the biomass was estimated using allometric equations based on dendrometric parameters. As an example of the potential use of P-band polarimetric images, they were classified by a contextual classifier (ICM), whose thematic stratification of land use/land cover was associated with biomass class intervals for mapping purposes. The main objective of this P-band experiment is to improve this tool for regional mapping of Amazon landscape changes, due to the growing rate of land use occupation. © 2003 Elsevier Inc.

In this paper, we use census and satellite records to develop maps of the distribution and abundance of major agricultural land uses across 4.5×108 ha of Brazilian Amazônia in 1980 and 1995. Results indicate an overall expansion of 7.0×106 ha in total agricultural area in Brazilian Amazônia between 1980 and 1995. The net change during this period is estimated for three different land-use types: croplands (an increase of 0.8×106 ha), natural pastures (a decrease of 8.4×106 ha), and planted pastures (an increase of 14.7×106 ha). These estimates, the first spatially explicit quantifications of agricultural land-use activities in 1980 and 1995 across Brazilian Amazônia, are shown to be consistent with the results of applying a land use change and secondary regrowth model to published deforestation rates for the period. The resulting time slices, presented for each land-use category at 5-min (∼9 km) spatial resolution, allow for the quantification of land-use changes in this region for biogeochemical, demographic and economic models. Several foci of agricultural change existed within Brazilian Amazônia during this period: in the state of Pará, cropland was lost and planted pasture increased markedly; in Mato Grosso, both cropland and planted pasture increased; in Rondônia, planted pasture replacing forest was the primary route to agricultural expansion. © 2003 Elsevier Inc.

LBA is an international research program developed to evaluate regional function and to determine how land-use and climate modify biological, chemical and physical processes there. Remote sensing has played a fundamental role in LBA in research planning, land-cover mapping and in long-term monitoring of changes in land-cover and land-use at multiple scales. This special issue includes 12 papers that cover a range in spatial scales from regional mapping to local scales that cover only a portion of a Landsat scene. Several themes dominate, including land-cover mapping with an emphasis on wetlands and second-growth forest, evaluation of pasture sustainability and forest degradation and the impact of land-cover change on stream chemistry. New techniques introduced include automated Monte Carlo unmixing (AutoMCU) and several new approaches for mapping land-cover. A diversity of sensors are utilized, including ETM+, IKONOS, SPOT-4, Airborne P-band synthetic aperture radar (SAR), and L-band SAR. Census data are fused with an existing land-cover map to generate spatially explicit estimates of land-use from historical data. Several papers include important, new field measures of species composition, forest structure and biomass in mature forest and secondary succession. © 2003 Elsevier Inc.

Methods using satellite imagery are well established for detecting forest fires in real time and mapping the burned area (fire scars) within one year of the fire. This paper focuses on the detection of older fire disturbance-regeneration patterns in the boreal forests of Canada. Previous work found that shortwave-infrared image segmentation proved particularly good at creating uniform regions that were easy to associate with fire scars. Our findings suggest it is possible to detect fire scars up to ten years old using SPOT-VEGETATION data from a single year and that the use of a vegetation index based on near- and shortwave-infrared reflectance is critical to this success. We demonstrate how the use of short-term multitemporal imagery can enhance segmentation results and present a threshold-based procedure for a posteriori identification of fire scar segments. The resulting fire scar probability map showed a good correspondence with records of fire scars mapped by the Canadian Forest Service for 1980-1992 and ""hot spots"" from the FireM3 Information System for 1994-1998.","Forest fire scars; Image segmentation; Multitemporal remote sensing; Shortwave-infrared","Data acquisition; Environmental impact; Forestry; Image quality; Image sensors; Infrared radiation; Radiometers; Remote sensing; Vegetation; Forest fire scars; Multitemporal remote sensing; Image segmentation","Natural Environment Research Council, NERC","Manuscript received September 30, 2002; revised July 14, 2003.

Although remote sensing methods for measuring plant litter cover provide both a wider area of coverage and a more objective estimate of the spatial variability of litter than manual methods of quantifying the nongreen vegetation landscape components (e.g., litter or soil percent cover), it has been difficult to assess the efficiency of detecting partial litter cover over different soil types. The objectives of this study were (i) to acquire spectral reflectance data for four crop residues and two forest litter types in mixed scenes of soil and plant litter, (ii) to derive relationships that show the spectral variable, cellulose absorption index (CAI), as a function of the amount of litter on the soil surface, and (iii) to test whether the variability of soil background reflectance inhibits the detection of residues and/or the ability to quantify residue cover. Scenes of known amounts of plant litter covering three contrasting soils were prepared and their reflectance spectra (0.4-2.5 μm) were measured with a hyper-resolution spectroradiometer. Litter from four crop (corn, soybean, rice, and wheat) and two tree species (coniferous and deciduous) were included. The CAI (0.5(R2.0 + R2.2) - R 2.1) describes the average depth of the cellulose absorption feature at 2.1 μm in reflectance spectra. Positive values of CAI indicate the presence of cellulose. The mean CAI of the soils was -2.0 while the mean CAI of the plant litter was 5.2. CAI increased linearly for each plant litter as the amount of plant litter in the scene increased from 0% (bare soil) to 100% cover. The CAI values of mixed scenes with more than 10% litter cover were significantly larger than the CAI values of the soils. The results of this study indicate that CAI is useful for quantifying plant litter cover, even at low percent cover. © 2003 Elsevier Inc.

In this study, small-footprint time-of-flight lidar data were used to estimate biophysical properties of tolerant hardwood forests composed predominantly of mature sugar maple (Acer saccharum Marsh.) and yellow birch (Betula alleghaniensis Britton) in the Turkey Lakes Watershed (TLW) near Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario. Ground reference data were collected during the first two weeks of July 2000 for 49 circular sample plots, each 0.04 ha (or 400 m2) in area. Lidar data were acquired on 24 August 2000 using an Optech ALTM 1225 (Optech Incorporated, Toronto, Ont.). Ten biophysical forest metrics were derived for each plot: (1) maximum tree height (hmax), (2) Lorey's mean tree height (hLorey), (3) mean diameter at breast height (DBH), (4) total basal area (BA), (5) percent canopy openness (CO%), (6) leaf area index (LAI), (7) ellipsoidal crown closure (CC), (8) total aboveground biomass (BIO), (9) total wood volume (VOL), and (10) stem density (SD). Likewise, three laser height metrics were derived for each plot: (1) maximum laser height (Lhmax), (2) mean laser height (Lhmean), and (3) mean laser height calculated from lidar returns filtered based on a threshold applied to the intensity return values (LhIR). The results demonstrate that for each forest with a given stand structure, there exists one or more laser height metrics derived from lidar data that are capable of providing an estimate of various biophysical properties. Lhmax was the best estimator of hmax (r2 = 0.79) and hLorey (r2 = 0.87); LhIR was the best estimator of BA (r2 = 0.85), BIO (r2 = 0.85), and VOL (r2 = 0.87); and Lhmean was the best estimator of CC (r2 = 0.89), DBH (r2 = 0.63), CO% (r2 = 0.76), LAI (r2 = 0.80), and SD (r2 = 0.86). The results illustrate the potential for laser height metrics to estimate (i) plot heights and stem densities, (ii) aboveground biomass and volume, and (iii) canopy-related measures. © 2003, Taylor &amp; Francis Group, LLC.

More specifically, AGTB conversion tables were devised to estimate biomass for stand attributes that are commonly mapped in provincial inventories over the Canadian landscape, i.e., species composition, projected crown density, and dominant tree height. AGTB is first estimated at the tree level using allometric relationships and measured stem distributions that are subsequently summed to estimate plot-level biomass. AGTB conversion tables are then computed from regression models that relate the plot-level biomass values to stand attributes. AGTB can then be mapped over the landscape by assigning the plot-level biomass values to the mapped stands. The method was developed using two provinces, Newfoundland and Labrador (N.L.) and Quebec, as test cases to assess the adaptation required between different management units. Models used to develop conversion tables from the test areas provided estimates of biomass with R 2 ranging from 0.22 to 0.35 and from 0.31 to 0.64 and root mean square errors of 38 to 47 t/ha and 21 to 41 t/ha for N.L. and Quebec, respectively, based on an independent validation data set not used in the development of the models. Mapping errors and potential improvements to the models are discussed. To extend the methods developed in this study to a national map of forest AGTB will require significant adjustments to account for differences in regional inventory specifications. While the method for AGTB mapping can fulfil an important monitoring requirement in forestry, applying it to all provinces, as well as including alternate data sources for areas where inventories do not exist, such as satellite remotely sensed images, requires further research, some of which is currently in progress.",,"Biomass; Image analysis; Mapping; Regression analysis; Remote sensing; Dominant tree height; Projected crown density; Forestry; aboveground biomass; estimation method; forest inventory; mapping; Newfoundland and Labrador; Quebec",,,,,,,,,,,,"Fournier, R.A.; Ctr. d'Applic.

Whilst it is well known that fire is widespread in the boreal environment, there is a lack of good quality quantitative data on the extent of fire activity in Russian forests and on its interannual variation. This study provides one of the first comprehensive monthly satellite-based studies of fires occurring across the entire Russian Federation using a single, standardised methodology designed to map burned areas down to a size of 2 km2. Using data from SPOT VEGETATION (VGT), we detect newly burned pixels via a series of multi-temporal spectral reflectance differencing criteria. For the year 2001, the method is applied to 21 VGT 10-day syntheses (S10) scenes covering the Russian fire season. We map 2764 fires with a total area of 41,782 km 2, and our methodology successfully detects all fires present in a comparison Landsat ETM+ data set, although it underestimates their size by on average of 18%. Using frequency-size relations, we estimate that 3790 fires of 1-2-km2 area are likely to have remained unobserved by our method across the entire Russian region. Taking these corrections into account, we calculate the total burned area for the Russian Federation in 2001 as 51,546 km2, with 38,512 km2 occurring in forest and 13,034 km2 in other land use classes. Fire activity is strongest in August in Eastern Siberia and the northern part of the Russian Far East, and in May and October in the southern part of the Russian Far East. Using these data, we estimate direct carbon emissions from these Russian forest fires to be 39.3-55. 4 Mt, five to eight times that from the 2001 North American boreal forest fires and around 11-17% of that year's Russian industrial carbon emissions. This methodology will, in the future, be applied to the full VGT archive to quantify burned area and direct carbon emissions over a 5-year period in order to better assess the interannual variation in burned area and emissions and the relation to local climate. © 2003 Elsevier Inc.

Results showed that during the 15-year period, mature pine plantation cover and young pine plantation cover declined by 9 percent and 2 percent, respectively, while open field increased by 10 percent. It was also determined that wetland forests declined by 5 percent. Because trees serve as highly efficient carbon storage devices, the decline in forest cover (pine plantation and wetland trees) leads to increased pollution of the atmosphere with carbon dioxide.","Deforestation; Forest; Image classification; Remote sensing","deforestation; Landsat thematic mapper; remote sensing; vegetation cover; Florida; North America; United States",,,,,,,,,,,,"Genc, L.; Geomatic/Civil and Coastal Eng., 345 Weil Hall, Gainesville, FL 32611-6580, United States",,,15381242,,,,"English","Surv.

Currently, radiative transfer analyses of lidar data are based on the simplifying assumption that only single scattering contributes to the return signal, which may lead to errors in the modeling of the lower portions of recorded waveforms in the near-infrared spectrum. In this study we apply time-dependent stochastic radiative transfer (RT) theory to model the propagation of lidar pulses through forest canopies. A time-dependent stochastic RT equation is formulated and solved numerically. Such an approach describes multiple scattering events, allows for realistic representation of forest structure including foliage clumping and gaps, simulates off-nadir and multiangular observations, and has the potential to provide better approximations of return waveforms. The model was tested with field data from two conifer forest stands (southern old jack pine and southern old black spruce) in central Canada and two closed canopy deciduous forest stands (with overstory dominated by tulip poplar) in eastern Maryland. Model-simulated signals were compared with waveforms recorded by the Scanning Lidar Imager of Canopies by Echo Recovery (SLICER) over these regions. Model simulations show good agreement with SLICER signals having a slow decay of the waveform. The analysis of the effects of multiple scattering shows that multiply scattered photons magnify the amplitude of the reflected signal, especially that originating from the lower portions of the canopy.

This paper reports a study on the feasibility of using remotely sensed data to estimate vegetative fuel loads. It describes two methods for estimating fuel loads using Landsat TM data based on equations describing litter accumulation and decomposition. The first method uses classification techniques to predict vegetation types coupled with fire history data to derive current fuel loads. The second method applies a canopy turnover rate to estimate litterfall and subsequently accumulated litter from biomass, thus utilising the dominant influence of canopy on remotely sensed data. Both methods are compared with data collected from Popran National Park in coastal New South Wales. The amounts of litter calculated with the biomass method were similar to field results, but the classification method was found to overestimate fuel loads. A sensitivity analysis investigated the impact of varying the vegetation constants and rates used in the fuel estimates to simulate uncertainty or error in their values. The biomass method was less subject to uncertainties and has potential for estimating fuel quantities to provide useful spatial information for fire managers.","Fire history; Litterfall; Remote sensing; Wildfire",,,,,,,,,,,,,"Jacobson, C.; Department of Physical Geography, Balaclava Road, North Ryde, NSW 2109, Australia; email: carol.jacobson@mq.edu.au",,,10498001,,,,"English","Int.

However, less is known about the effects on ecosystems following fire, which include reduced productivity and changes in decomposition in the decade immediately following the disturbance. In this study, we assessed the impact of fire on net primary productivity (NPP) in the North American boreal forest using a 17-year record of satellite NDVI observations at 8-km spatial resolution together with a light-use efficiency model. We identified 61 fire scars in the satellite observations using digitized fire burn perimeters from a database of large fires. We studied the postfire response of NPP by analyzing the most impacted pixel within each burned area. NPP decreased in the year following the fire by 60-260g CM-2 yr-1 (30-80%). By comparing pre- and postfire observations, we estimated a mean NPP recovery period for boreal forests of about 9 years, with substantial variability among fires. We incorporated this behavior into a carbon cycle model simulation to demonstrate these effects on net ecosystem production. The disturbance resulted in a release of C to the atmosphere during the first 8 years, followed by a small, but long-lived, sink lasting 150 years. Postfire net emissions were three times as large as from a model run without changing NPP. However, only small differences in the C cycle occurred between runs after 8 years due to the rapid recovery of NPP. We conclude by discussing the effects of fire on the long-term continental trends in satellite NDVI observed across boreal North America during the 1980s and 1990s.","Boreal forest; Carbon cycle; Emissions; Fire; NDVI; Net primary productivity","boreal forest; carbon cycle; fire; NDVI; net primary production; remote sensing; North America",,,,,,,,,,,,"Hicke, J.A.; Natural Resource Ecology Laboratory, , Fort Collins, CO 80523, United States; email: jhicke@nrel.colostate.edu",,,13541013,,,,"English","Global Change Biol.",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-0041417421

A model for the automatic extraction of forest information is demonstrated to provide spatial coverage of the study area, making it possible to produce 3-D inputs to improve fire behavior models. The Toposys I airborne laser system recorded the last return of each footprint (0.30-0.38 m) over a 2000 m by 190 m flight line. Raw data were transformed into height above the surface, eliminating the effect of terrain on vegetation height and allowing separation of ground surface and crown heights. Data were defined as ground elevation if heights were less than 0.6 m. A cluster analysis was used to discriminate crown base height, allowing identification of both tree and understory canopy heights. Tree height was defined as the 99 percentile of the tree crown height group, while crown base height was the 1 percentile of the tree crown height group. Tree cover (TC) was estimated from the fraction of total tree laser hits relative to the total number of laser hits. Surface canopy (SC) height was computed as the 99 percentile of the surface canopy group. Surface canopy cover is equal to the fraction of total surface canopy hits relative to the total number of hits, once the canopy height profile (CHP) was corrected. Crown bulk density (CBD) was obtained from foliage biomass (FB) estimate and crown volume (CV), using an empirical equation for foliage biomass. Crown volume was estimated as the crown area times the crown height after a correction for mean canopy cover. © 2003 Elsevier Science Inc.

The study is conducted at two heterogeneous sites in the boreal forest of Central Canada. Using a Twin Otter aircraft, fluxes were measured in a grid pattern during three Intensive Field Campaigns (IFCs) and Landsat thematic mapper data were used for land cover classification. Using a footprint function developed from tracer gas release experiments in the boreal forest, the fractions of cover types within the footprint were determined, and used in a regression analysis against observed fluxes. The results showed that the surface cover types within the flux footprint accounted for about 90% of the variations in the measured airborne fluxes of CO2, sensible heat and latent heat, at two different study sites. The attempted validation of the regression models, by comparing flux estimates over regional transects outside the grid area for which the regression model had been developed or over site-specific runs within the grid area against observed fluxes, based on fractional distributions of surface cover types, were encouraging.

Due to the complex ownership pattern dominated by thousands of non-industrial private forest (NIPF) owners and the difficulty of detecting selective logging using remote sensing, details of the harvesting regime remain largely unknown to the scientific and policy communities. To examine the value of statewide regulatory data for Massachusetts as a unique source of this critical information, we analyzed 17 years of timber harvest data gathered for regulatory purposes for a 168,000 ha forested landscape in Massachusetts that is the focus of concerted conservation planning and intensive study of landscape and ecosystem pattern and process. The North Quabbin Region is heavily wooded with a complicated ownership pattern dominated by over 2500 NIPF owners, three state agencies, and diverse conservation and municipal holdings. The extent and intensity of harvesting were surprising, with an annual disturbance rate of 1.5% and a mean intensity of 44.7 m3 ha-1 (approximately one-fourth of average stand volume). The predominant form of harvesting was selective removal of commercially valuable tree sizes, grades and species (e.g., Quercus rubra and Pinus strobus). The spatial pattern of logging was random with regards to major physical, biological, or cultural factors. However, logging was strongly related to landowner class. NIPF owners control 60% of the forest area and were responsible for 64.1% of harvest area, but the highest logging intensity (volume per area harvested; 69.3 m3 ha-1) among major landowners was conducted by the state agency responsible for managing southern New England's largest conservation property, the watershed of Boston's drinking reservoir. This regime of chronic disturbance is occurring over the entire landscape and exerting a major influence on forest composition, dynamics, and habitat quality. However, dispersed selective harvesting is largely unnoticed by residents, is routinely overlooked by ecologists and conservationists, and would remain unrecognized in the absence of this previously unused regulatory data. These results identify the value of regional regulatory spatial information to estimate ecological trends and to assist in conservation planning. Given similarities among ownership and forest patterns for much of the northeastern US, we expect that the broad findings of this study to have regional application. © 2002 Elsevier B.V.

This study was conducted to evaluate patterns in an 18-year record of global satellite observations of vegetation phenology from the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) as a means to characterize major ecosystem disturbance events and regimes. The fraction absorbed of photosynthetically active radiation (FPAR) by vegetation canopies worldwide has been computed at a monthly time interval from 1982 to 1999 and gridded at a spatial resolution of 0.5° latitude/longitude. Potential disturbance events of large extent (>0.5 Mha) were identified in the FPAR time series by locating anomalously low values (FPAR-LO) that lasted longer than 12 consecutive months at any 0.5° pixel. We find that nearly 400 Mha of the global land surface could be identified with at least one FPAR-LO event over the 18-year time series. The majority of these potential disturbance events occurred in tropical savanna and shrublands or in boreal forest ecosystem classes. Verification of potential disturbance events from our FPAR-LO analysis was carried out using documented records of the timing of large-scale wildfires at locations throughout the world. Disturbance regimes were further characterized by association analysis with historical climate anomalies. Assuming accuracy of the FPAR satellite record to characterize major ecosystem disturbance events, we estimate that nearly 9 Pg of carbon could have been lost from the terrestrial biosphere to the atmosphere as a result of large-scale ecosystem disturbance over this 18-year time series.","Carbon; Climate; Disturbance; Ecosystems; Remote sensing","AVHRR; carbon cycle; disturbance; global change; remote sensing; terrestrial ecosystem; Siganus",,,,,,,,,,,,"Potter, C.; NASA Ames Research Center, Moffett Field, CA, United States; email: cpotter@gaia.arc.nasa.gov",,,13541013,,,,"English","Global Change Biol.",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0042632649

The study of the infrared spectral radiance emitted by a biomass fire has been used to define spectral algorithms that permit to separate fires from other sources considered as false alarms. The different behaviour of the medium (3-5 μm) and thermal (8-12 μm) infrared spectral regions has been the basis for the definition of a new ""figure"" of merit, the so-called Fire Index (FI). An experimental burn has been used to test the ability of FI to identify clearly fires. A second algorithm based on an intraband analysis, the Mid-IR Fire Index (MFI), has been proposed to give complementary information to FI. Evolution of FI and MFI values with distance for different IR sources has been calculated. Finally, an experimental validation of both algorithms has been performed by using two infrared cameras working in the medium and thermal infrared spectral windows. © 2003 Elsevier Science Inc.

The image set covers a single forested test area in Finland, and both summer (snow-free) and winter conditions are represented. The data set enabled (a) the study of stem volume retrieval performance under varying conditions, (b) the analysis of the seasonal behavior of interferometric coherence, and (c) the determination of the accuracy characteristics of empirical (nonlinear) coherence modeling. Additionally, a new technique to estimate forest stem volume from INSAR data was developed based on constrained iterative inversion of the applied empirical model. The results indicate that the usability of winter images with snow-covered terrain is superior to that of images obtained under summer conditions. The applied empirical model appears to be adequate for describing the stand-wise coherence of boreal forest. Hence, a practical stem volume estimation method can be established based on it. The highest correlation coefficient between the estimated stem volume and the ground truth stem volume showed values as high as r=0.9 and a relative RMSE level of 48% was obtained, respectively. © 2003 Elsevier Science Inc.

Here, the ability to generalize in space was investigated through an analysis of the transferability of predictive relations for the estimation of tropical forest biomass from Landsat TM data between sites in Brazil, Malaysia and Thailand. The data sets for each test site were acquired and processed in a similar fashion to facilitate the analyses. Three types of predictive relation, based on vegetation indices, multiple regression and feedforward neural networks, were developed for biomass estimation at each site. For each site, the strongest relationships between the biomass predicted and that measured from field survey was obtained with a neural network developed specifically for the site (r>0.71, significant at the 99% level of confidence). However, with each type of approach problems in transferring a relation to another site were observed. In particular, it was apparent that the accuracy of prediction, as indicated by the correlation coefficient between predicted and measured biomass, declined when a relation was transferred to a site other than that upon which it was developed. Part of this problem lies with the observed variation in the relative contribution of the different spectral wavebands to predictive relations for biomass estimation between sites. It was, for example, apparent that the spectral composition of the vegetation indices most strongly related to biomass differed greatly between the sites. Consequently, the relationship between predicted and measured biomass derived from vegetation indices differed markedly in both strength and direction between sites. Although the incorporation of test site location information into an analysis resulted in an increase in the strength of the relationship between predicted and actual biomass, considerable further research is required on the problems associated with transferring predictive relations. © 2003 Elsevier Science Inc.

Synthetic aperture radars (SARs), with their sensitivity to forest biomass, offer mapping capabilities that could provide valuable up-to-date information, for example about fire damage or logging activity. The European Commission SIBERIA project had the aim of mapping an area of approximately 1 million km2 in Siberia using SAR data from two satellite sources: the tandem mission of the European Remote Sensing Satellites ERS-1/2 and the Japanese Earth Resource Satellite JERS-1. Mosaics of ERS tandem interferometric coherence and JERS backscattering coefficient show the wealth of information contained in these data but they also show large differences in radar response between neighbouring images. To create one homogeneous forest map, adaptive methods which are able to account for brightness changes due to environmental effects were required. In this paper an adaptive empirical model to determine growing stock volume classes using the ERS tandem coherence and the JERS backscatter data is described. For growing stock volume classes up to 80 m3/ha, accuracies of over 80% are achieved for over a hundred ERS frames at a spatial resolution of 50 m. © 2003 Elsevier Science Inc.

The propagation characteristics of the low-frequency electromagnetic wave are severely affected by the ionosphere. Recently, Faraday rotation effects and SAR image degradation have been studied using an analytical model and a homogeneous ionosphere. In this paper, a numerical model is developed to investigate the SAR image degradation caused by an inhomogeneous ionosphere. Both horizontal and vertical structures of the ionosphere are considered in this model. Three different cases are studied. The first is a vertically homogenous ionosphere, where the simulation condition is the same as in the analytical study by Ishimaru and others. The second is a vertical profile, which is introduced using the Chapman formula. The ray-bending effect is added for the ionosphere with a layered structure. Finally, both the vertical profile in electron density and the horizontal gradient in total electron content are considered in the simulation. Simulation results show good agreement with the theoretical analysis under the same conditions of the ionosphere. When both horizontal and vertical structures and the inhomogeneity of the ionosphere are considered in the model, the simulation result shows further image degradation and shift caused by the ray-bending effect. The simulation results also show the strong frequency dependence of the SAR image resolution. © 2003 IEEE.","Ionospheric electromagnetic propagation; Remote sensing; Synthetic aperture radar (SAR)","Computer simulation; Image resolution; Imaging systems; Ionospheric electromagnetic wave propagation; Mathematical models; Numerical methods; Image degradation; Ionospheric electromagnetic propagation; Underground facilities; Vertical structures; Synthetic aperture radar","National Aeronautics and Space Administration, NASA; Jet Propulsion Laboratory, JPL","Manuscript received August 14, 2002; revised January 28, 2003.

In EPPML, leaf area index (LAI) that greatly influenced vegetation productivity was received from remote sensing images, the spatial distribution and temporal dynamics of net primary productivity (NPP) and evapotranspiration were simulated. Geographical information system (GIS) was used to process, analyze, and display spatial data. Thus, the studies on physiological ecology could be extended, and converted from small scale to larger scale. Using EPPML, the vegetation productivity in Changbai Mountain Natural Reserve in 1995 was simulated. EPPML could well and truly simulate the NPP of main vegetations in the natural reserve. NPP was estimated to be 0.680 kg C·m-2, yr.-1, mostly ranging from 0.105 to 1.241 kg C·m-2, yr.-1, accounting for 82.1 %. The highest NPP (1.084 kg C·m-2, yr-1) appeared in mixed broad-leaved and Korean pine forests. The total NPP was estimated to be 1.332 × 106 t C· yr-1. The highest total NPP appeared in mixed broad-leaved and Korean pine forests and spruce-fir forest, which were 0.540 × 106 t C · yr.-1 and 0.428 × 106 t C· yr.-1, respectively. The seasonal variation of NPP appeared obvious single peak with peak value in July (6.13 g C·m-2·d-1). The most NPP accumulated in the summer, which was 0.465 kg C·m-2, secondly in the spring, and least in the winter.","Changbai mountain natural reserve; Ecosystem productivity; Landscape scale; Net primary productivity; Process model; Remote sensing data; Surface data","ecosystem modeling; GIS; landscape; net primary production; productivity; remote sensing; article; ecosystem; energy conservation; geographic information system; growth, development and aging; metabolism; plant leaf; season; telecommunication; theoretical model; tree; Conservation of Energy Resources; Ecosystem; Geographic Information Systems; Models, Theoretical; Plant Leaves; Satellite Communications; Seasons; Trees; China; Abies; Picea; Pinus koraiensis",,,,,,,,,,,,"Zhang, N.; College of Earth Sciences, , Beijing 100039, China; email: zhangna@gscas.ac.cn",,,10019332,,,"12924111","English","Chin.

Differences of reciprocal reflectances [(ρGreen)-1 - (ρNIR)-1] and [(ρRedEdge -1 - (ρNIR)-1] accounted for more than 90 percent of the variability in mid-day canopy photosynthesis of irrigated maize.

Fits of field biomass measurements to model functions of remotely sensed leaf area density produced agreement between the field and remotely sensed biomasses at the level of 25 tons/ha, or 16% of the average stand biomass. The errors in the field and remote sensing observations indicated that this level of agreement was significant with greater than 99.5% confidence.

Soil water content had a negative correlativity with NPP, and the correlation coefficient (R) was -0.65. Therefore, water was sufficient for the growth of plants in Changbai Mountain. NPP was highly correlated with LAI (R = 0.81). When LAI was greater than 4-5 m-2 · m-2, NPP became saturated. NPP was also highly correlated with canopy transpiration (R = 0.77).

The methodology is based on a multiple threshold approach applied to the thermal radiance and to a spectral index specific for burned surfaces. The Simple Index for Burned Areas (SIBA), also developed in this study, makes use of the information contained in the visible and thermal InfraRed (IR) band available on the geostationary satellites, whose main advantages are the high temporal resolution and the minimal level of pre-processing required. The results obtained with Meteosat data have been evaluated comparing them with NOAA-Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) data acquired over the Central Africa forest-savannah areas. For GMS imagery, AVHRR data acquired over the woodland-savannah areas of Northern Territory in Australia have been used. Despite the very low spatial and spectral resolution of the data, accuracy assessment showed at a regional and continental scale the resulting burned area maps could be a valuable source of information for the monitoring of the fire activity and for the assessment of fire impact on tropospheric chemistry. © 2003 Elsevier Science Inc.

MODIS has a unique ability to observe fires, smoke, and burn scars globally. Its main fire detection channels saturate at high brightness temperatures: 500 K at 4 μm and 400 K at 11 μm, which can only be attained in rare circumstances at the 1 km fire detection spatial resolution. Thus, unlike other polar orbiting satellite sensors with similar thermal and spatial resolutions, but much lower saturation temperatures (e.g. Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer and Along Track Scanning Radiometer), MODIS can distinguish between low intensity ground surface fires and high intensity crown forest fires. Smoke column concentration over land is for the first time being derived from the MODIS solar channels, extending from 0.41 μm to 2.1 μm. The smoke product has been provisionally validated both globally and regionally over southern Africa and central and south America. Burn scars are observed from MODIS even in the presence of smoke, using the 1.2 to 2.1 μm channels. MODIS burned area information is used to estimate pyrogenic emissions. A wide range of these fire and related products and validation are demonstrated for the wild fires that occured in northwestern USA in Summer 2000. The MODIS rapid response system and direct broadcast capability is being developed to enable users to obtain and generate data in near real-time. It is expected that health and land management organizations will use these systems for monitoring the occurence of fires and the dispersion of smoke within two to six hours after data acquisition.",,"Fire detectors; Imaging techniques; Radiometers; Scanning; Sensors; Smoke; Spectrum analysis; Spatial resolutions; Remote sensing; algorithm; biomass burning; detection method; fire management; MODIS; remote sensing; smoke",,,,,,,,,,,,"Kaufman, Y.J.; NASA/Goddard SFC, , Greenbelt, MD 20771, United States; email: kaufman@climate.gsfc.nasa.gov",,"Taylor and Francis Ltd.",01431161,,IJSED,,"English","Int.

Multitemporal Landsat-7 ETM + data were acquired to produce a high spatial resolution map of areas burned between mid-August and late September 2000, and a field campaign was conducted in early November 2000 to gather ground truth data. Mapping of burned areas was performed with an ensemble of classification trees and yielded a kappa value of 0.896. This map was subsequently degraded to a spatial resolution of 500 m, to produce an estimate of burned area fraction, at the MODIS pixel size. Correlation analysis between the sub-pixel burned area fraction map and the MODIS reflective channels 1-7 yielded low but statistically significant correlations for all channels. The better correlations were obtained for MODIS channels 2 (0.86 μm), 5 (1.24 μm) and 6 (1.64 μm). A regression tree was constructed to predict sub-pixel burned area fraction as a function of those MODIS channels. The resulting tree has nine terminal nodes and an overall root mean square error of 0.252. The regression tree analysis confirmed that MODIS channels 2, 5, and 6 are the best predictors of burned area fraction. It may be possible to improve these results considering, as an alternative to individual channels, some appropriate spectral indices used to enhance the burnt scar signal, and by including MODIS thermal data in the analysis. It may also be possible to improve the accuracy of sub-pixel burned area fraction using MODIS imagery by allowing the regression tree to automatically create linear combinations of individual channels, and by using ensembles of trees.",,"Correlation methods; Error analysis; Imaging techniques; Mapping; Radiometers; Regression analysis; Thermoanalysis; Spatial resolutions; Remote sensing; biomass burning; detection method; fire management; forest fire; mapping; MODIS; pixel; (North); Mozambique","Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia, FCT; Fundació Catalana de Trasplantament, FCT: SFRH/BD/1026/2000, SFRH/BD/891/2000","We are very grateful to several people who contributed to make this study possible.

One of the 1997 experimental sites was the Peyne catchment in southern France. The objectives of the experimental flight were to evaluate the technical performance of DAIS and to assess the feasibility of mapping the above-ground biomass of the Mediterranean mixed oak forest. Field campaigns were organized to collect data for image calibration and for image interpretation and analyses. The technical performance of DAIS in 1997 was reasonable for visible and near-infrared wave-lengths. The images in short-wave infrared showed severe striping due to aircraft engine vibrations. Signal-to-noise ratios were modest. Field biomass estimates at 83 locations were used to analyse the image spectra. Various well-known spectral indices and a multiple regression analyses were tested for mapping above-ground biomass. The multiple regression method yielded five spectral bands for biomass prediction. Based on the spatial distribution of the regression residuals, it was possible to indicate the reliability of the biomass prediction as a function of location and as a function of biomass level using geostatistics.",,"Biomass; Catchments; Data acquisition; Forestry; Regression analysis; Signal to noise ratio; Spectrometry; Experimental flights; Remote sensing; airborne sensing; biomass; forest; forestry production; geostatistics; spectral reflectance; spectrometry; Biomass; Forests; Regression Analysis; Remote Sensing; Spectrometers; Spectroscopy; France; Peyne River","European Commission, EC; Deutsches Zentrum für Luft- und Raumfahrt, DLR","over the last 25 years showed that high resolution spectral data in the 0.4–2.5 mm region would improve vegetation, mineral-and soil property survey due to the presence of diagnostic absorption features in the reflectance curves (Goetz et al. 1985, De Jong 1994a, Danson and Plummer 1995, Smith and Curran 1996, Kokaly and Clark 1999).

GIS-based fire scar maps for most regions of Canada are used to develop a remote sensing algorithm for mapping and dating forest burned areas in the 25 yr prior to 1998. These mapped and dated burned areas are used in combination with inventory data to produce a complete image of forest stand age in 1998. Empirical NPP age relationships were used to simulate the annual variations of forest growth and carbon balance in 1 km pixels, each treated as a homogeneous forest stand. Annual CO2 flux data from four sites were used for model validation. Averaged over the period 1990-1998, the carbon source and sink map for Canada's forests show the following features: (i) large spatial variations corresponding to the patchiness of recent fire scars and productive forests and (ii) a general south-to-north gradient of decreasing carbon sink strength and increasing source strength. This gradient results mostly from differential effects of temperature increase on growing season length, nutrient mineralization and heterotrophic respiration at different latitudes as well as from uneven nitrogen deposition. The results from the present study are compared with those of two previous studies. The comparison suggests that the overall positive effects of non-disturbance factors (climate, CO2 and nitrogen) outweighed the effects of increased disturbances in the last two decades, making Canada's forests a carbon sink in the 1980s and 1990s. Comparisons of the modeled results with tower-based eddy covariance measurements of net ecosystem exchange at four forest stands indicate that the sink values from the present study may be underestimated.",,"atmosphere-biosphere interaction; boreal forest; boundary layer; carbon flux; source-sink dynamics; spatial distribution; Canada",,,,,,,,,,,,"Chen, J.M.; Department of Geography, 100 St. George St., Toronto, Ont.

LAI is a key variable for regional and global models of biosphere- atmosphere exchanges of energy, carbon dioxide, water vapour, and other materials. The location is global, geographically distributed. Biomes with LAI values well represented in the literature included croplands, forests and plantations,. Biomes not well represented were deserts, shrublands, tundra and wetlands. Nearly 40% of the records in the database were published in the past 10 years (1991-2000). with a further 20% collected between 1981 and 1990. Mean (± SD) LAI, distributed between 15 biome classes, ranged from 1.3 ± 0/9 for deserts to 8.7 ± 4.3 for tree plantations, with temperate evergreen forests (needleleaf and broadleaf) displaying the highest average LAI (5.1-6.7) among the natural terrestrial vegetation classes. Following a statistical outlier analysis, the global mean (± SD) LAI decreased from 5.2 (4.1) to 4.5 (2.5), with a maximum LAI of 1.8 Biomes with the highest LAI values were plantations > temperate evergreen forests > wetlands. Those with the lowest LAI values were deserts < grasslands < tundra. Mean LAI values for all biomes did not differ statistically by the methodology employed. Direct and indirect measurement approaches produced similar LAI results. Mean LAI values for all biomes combined decreased significantly in the 1990s, a period of substantially more studies and improved methodologies. Applications of the LAI database span a wide range of ecological, biogeochemical, physical, and climate research areas. The data provide input to terrestrial ecosystem and land-surface models, for evaluation of global remote sensing products, for comparisons to field studies, and other applications. Example uses of the database for global plant productivity, fractional energy absorption, and remote sensing studies are highlighted.","Canopy structure; Ecosystem modelling; Global ecology; LAI; Leaf area index; Remote sensing","biome; canopy; ecosystem modeling; leaf area index; remote sensing; geographical distribution",,,,,,,,,,,,"Asner, G.P.; Department of Global Ecology, , Stanford, CA 94305, United States; email: greg@globalecology.stanford.edu",,,1466822X,,GEBIF,,"English","Global Ecol.

However, coarse spatial resolution analyses used to evaluate the terrestrial contribution to global NEP do not generally incorporate these effects. In this study, a fine-scale (25 m grid) analysis of NEP over a 164-km2 area of productive coniferous forests in the Pacific Northwest region of the United States was made to evaluate the effects of including fine scale information in landscape-scale NEP assessments. The Enhanced Thematic Mapper (ETM+) sensor resolved five cover classes in the study area and further differentiated between young, mature and old-growth conifer stands. ETM+ was also used to map current leaf area index (LAI) based on an empirical relationship of observed LAI to spectral vegetation indices. A daily time step climatology, based on 18 years of meteorological observations, was distributed (1 km resolution) over the mountainous terrain of the study area using the DAYMET model. Estimates of carbon pools and flux associated with soil, litter, coarse woody debris and live trees were then generated by running a carbon cycle model (Biome-BGC) to a state that reflected the current successional status and LAI of each grid cell, as indicated by the remote sensing observations. Estimated annual NEP for 1997 over the complete study area averaged 230 g C m-2, with most of the area acting as a carbon sink. The area-wide NEP is strongly positive because of reduced harvesting in the last decade and the recovery of areas harvested between 1940 and 1990. The average value was greater than would be indicated if the entire area was assumed to be a mature conifer stand, as in a coarse-scale analysis. The mean NEP varied interannually by over a factor of two. This variation was 38% less than the interannual variation for a single point. The integration of process models with ground surface information provided by remote sensing provides a framework for investigating mechanisms regulating NEP and evaluating coarse resolution globally applied NEP scaling efforts.",,"atmosphere-biosphere interaction; boundary layer; carbon flux; coniferous forest; land use; source-sink dynamics; terrestrial ecosystem",,,,,,,,,,,,"Turner, D.P.; Department of Forest Science, , Corvallis, OR 97331, United States; email: david.turner@oregonstate.edu",,,02806509,,,,"English","Tellus, Ser.

Progress in canopy-level photosynthesis modeling suggests that simpler big-leaf photosynthesis models are giving ways to more complex sunlit/shaded leaf separation models. This advancement in ecological modeling has increased the demand for advanced description of canopy architecture. Such demand may be mostly met through the use of multi-angle remote sensing techniques. In addition to leaf area index (LAI), another canopy parameter, the foliage clumping index, can be derived from multi-angle remote sensing. These two parameters are the basis for separating sunlit and shaded leaves. As leaf photosynthesis is nonlinearly related to incident radiation, such separation avoids the problems of big-leaf models that only make use of the total radiation absorption by the canopy without considering the distribution of radiation among leaves. A practical conclusion is that the traditional way of mapping the net primary productivity (NPP) through its correlation with the remotely sensed fraction of photosynthetically active radiation (FPAR) absorbed by plant canopies is only a very crude approximation and could be replaced with mapping LAI and clumping index and modeling NPP with advanced photosynthesis models. This is a step forward in remote sensing applications because single-angle remote sensing can only acquire information on the effective LAI related to the canopy gap fraction in the viewing direction and the amount of shaded leaf area is unknown. © 2002 Elsevier Science Inc.

Regression analysis has been a popular empirical method of linking these two types of data to provide continuous estimates for variables such as biomass, percent woody canopy cover, and leaf area index (LAI). Traditional methods of regression are not sufficient when resulting biophysical surfaces derived from remote sensing are subsequently used to drive ecosystem process models. Most regression analyses in remote sensing rely on a single spectral vegetation index (SVI) based on red and near-infrared reflectance from a single date of imagery. There are compelling reasons for utilizing greater spectral dimensionality, and for including SVIs from multiple dates in a regression analysis. Moreover, when including multiple SVIs and/or dates, it is useful to integrate these into a single index for regression modeling. Selection of an appropriate regression model, use of multiple SVIs from multiple dates of imagery as predictor variables, and employment of canonical correlation analysis (CCA) to integrate these multiple indices into a single index represent a significant strategic improvement over existing uses of regression analysis in remote sensing. To demonstrate this improved strategy, we compared three different types of regression models to predict LAI for an agro-ecosystem and live tree canopy cover for a needleleaf evergreen boreal forest: traditional (Y on X) ordinary least squares (OLS) regression, inverse (X on Y) OLS regression, and an orthogonal regression method called reduced major axis (RMA). Each model incorporated multiple SVIs from multiple dates and CCA was used to integrate these. For a given dataset, the three regression-modeling approaches produced identical coefficients of determination and intercepts, but different slopes, giving rise to divergent predictive characteristics. The traditional approach yielded the lowest root mean square error (RMSE), but the variance in the predictions was lower than the variance in the observed dataset. The inverse method had the highest RMSE and the variance was inflated relative to the variance of the observed dataset. RMA provided an intermediate set of predictions in terms of the RMSE, and the variance in the observations was preserved in the predictions. These results are predictable from regression theory, but that theory has been essentially ignored within the discipline of remote sensing. © 2002 Elsevier Science Inc.

However, owing to the complex structure, variable geography, and large area of forests, accurate estimation of forest carbon stocks is still a challenge for both site surveying and remote sensing. For these reasons, the Kyoto Protocol requires the establishment of methodologies for estimating the carbon stocks of forests (Kyoto Protocol, Article 5). A possible solution to this challenge is to remotely measure the carbon stocks of every tree in an entire forest. Here, we present a methodology for estimating carbon stocks of a Japanese cedar forest by using a high-resolution, helicopter-borne 3-dimensional (3-D) scanning lidar system that measures the 3-D canopy structure of every tree in a forest. Results show that a digital image (10-cm mesh) of woody canopy can be acquired. The treetop can be detected automatically with a reasonable accuracy. The absolute error ranges for tree height measurements are within 42 cm. Allometric relationships of height to carbon stocks then permit estimation of total carbon storage by measurement of carbon stocks of every tree. Thus, we suggest that our methodology can be used to accurately estimate the carbon stocks of Japanese cedar forests at a stand scale. Periodic measurements will reveal changes in forest carbon stocks.",,"Carbon; Optical radar; Remote sensing; Surveying; Variable geography; Forestry; canopy architecture; carbon sink; estimation method; forest; lidar; remote sensing; accuracy; allometry; analytical error; article; canopy; carbon storage; forest; geography; helicopter; rating scale; remote sensing; tree; Automation; Carbon; Cedrus; Environmental Monitoring; Light; Sensitivity and Specificity; Trees; Carbon; Forestry; Remote Sensing; Surveying; Cryptomeria japonica",,,,,,,,,,,,"Omasa, K.; Grad.

The location of the peak wavelength of the ground spectral measurements and a cluster analysis of the satellite measurements both separated the lakes into two distinct groups with different DOC concentrations. An analysis of the potential sources of DOC identified three variables important for the prediction of DOC concentrations within the lake, flushing rate and the area of both deciduous forest and open area within the watershed (r2 = 0.41).

A primary need in the coastal Pacific Northwest of the United States is information on the extent and rate of development of mature forest structure. The objective of this study was to evaluate alternative sampling schemes within a standard national cluster plot design able to efficiently determine density of large live trees and snags, tree mortality, and tree species richness. A simulation approach used stem maps from 19 permanent forest plots dominated by mature Pseudotsuga menziesii (Douglas-fir) of at least 1 ha in size that had been sampled for up to 23 years. Clustered subplots sampling between 0.5 and 81% of the stand area were randomly located in stands to select mapped trees. Estimation error analysis compared the percent difference between sample data and full-stand values by subplot size for 30 iterations per subplot size per stand. Comparison with analyses of regional inventory plots allowed greater inference concerning results. Samples of at least 40% of a stand (four 18 m radius subplots) were required to reduce errors for estimated density of large trees (±122 cm DBH) below 25% of true density at least 66% of the time. For mortality, subplots sampling at least 50% of a stand were needed to reach errors below 50% of true mortality at least 66% of the time. However, for trees <75 cm DBH, the standard inventory sample of 0.07 ha with four 7.3 m radius subplots did meet these accuracy levels for density and mortality. Relatively large plots were required to estimate species richness within one species of true richness, particularly for the relatively diverse smaller tree size classes. Efficient sampling of species richness could use species lists, instead of measuring many small trees on large plots. Reducing sample errors to acceptable levels will increase the utility of inventory plot data to evaluate stand structure, successional development, carbon sequestration, species diversity, and ground-truth for remote sensing. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

In this study, we examine the generality of relationships between lidar metrics and forest structural characteristics, including AGBM, from two study areas in Central America with different precipitation patterns. A series of tropical moist forest sites in Panama and a tropical wet forest in Costa Rica. Canopy metrics (e.g. canopy height) were calculated from airborne lidar data. Basal area, mean stem diameter and AGBM were calculated from measurements taken as a part of ongoing forest dynamics studies in both area. We examined the generality of relationship between lidar metrics and forest structure, and possible environmental effects (e.g. leaf phenology). We found that lidar metrics were strongly correlated (R2: 0.65-0.92 with mean stem diameter, basal area and AGBM in both regions. We also show that the relationships differed between these regions. Deciduousness of canopy trees in the tropical moist forest area accounted for the differences in predictive equations for stem diameter and basal area. The relationships between lidar metrics and AGBM, however, remained significantly different between the two study areas even after adjusting for leaf drop. We attribute this to significant differences in the underlying allometric relationships between stem diameter and AGBM in tropical wet and moist forests. Important forest structural characteristics can be estimated reliably across a variety of conditions sampled in these closed-canopy tropical forests. Environmental factors such as drought deciduousness have an important influence on these relationships. Future efforts should continue to examine climatic factors that may influence the generality of the relationships between lidar metrics and forest structural characteristics and assess more rigorously the generality of field-derived allometric relationships.","Above-ground biomass; Allometry; Carbon cycle; Central America; Environmental factors; Forest structure; Laser altimetry; Lidar; Remote sensing; Tropical forests","aboveground biomass; canopy; estimation method; lidar; Neotropical region; remote sensing; allometry; drought; environmental factor; Costa Rica; Panama; Central America; Panama [Central America]",,,,,,,,,,,,"Drake, J.B.; D.B.

For the purposes of calibrating and validating the light use efficiency (εg) algorithms, the components of εg - absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (APAR) and ecosystem GPP - must be measured in a variety of environments. Micrometeorological and mass flux measurements at eddy covariance flux towers can be used to estimate APAR and GPP, and the emerging network of flux tower sites offers the opportunity to investigate spatial and temporal patterns in εg at the daily time step. In this study, we examined the relationship of daily GPP to APAR, and relationship of εg to climatic variables, at four micrometeorological flux tower sites - an agricultural field, a tallgrass prairie, a deciduous forest, and a boreal forest. The relationship of GPP to APAR was close to linear at the tallgrass prairie site but more nearly hyperbolic at the other sites. The sites differed in the mean and range of daily εg, with higher values associated with the agricultural field than the boreal forest. εg decreased with increasing APAR at all sites, a function of mid-day saturation of GPP and higher εg under overcast conditions. εg was generally not well correlated with vapor pressure deficit or maximum daily temperature. At the agricultural site, a εg decline towards the end of the growing season was associated with a decrease in foliar nitrogen concentration. At the tallgrass prairie site, a decline in εg in August was associated with soil drought. These results support inclusion of parameters for cloudiness and the phenological status of the vegetation, as well as use of biome-specific parameterization, in operational εg algorithms.","Absorbed photosynthetic radiation; Carbon cycle; Eddy covariance; Gross primary production; Light use efficiency; Remote sensing","biome; carbon cycle; light use efficiency; photosynthetically active radiation; primary production; remote sensing",,,,,,,,,,,,"Turner, D.P.; Department of Forest Science, , Corvallis, OR 97331-7501, United States; email: david.turner@oregonstate.edu",,,13541013,,,,"English","Global Change Biol.",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0037355194

Statistical tests indicate that the regression model can be used to represent the relation between forest biomass and NDVI across spatial, temporal and ecological scales for relatively long time scales. For the 1.42 billion ha of boreal and temperate forests in the Northern Hemisphere, the woody biomass carbon pools and sinks are estimated at a relatively high spatial resolution (8 x 8 km).

This letter investigates the impact of future climate change on the boreal forest carbon budget by driving the FOREST-BGC (-Bio-Geochemical Cycling) ESM (under three different carbon dioxide (CO2) emission scenarios) using remotely sensed (NOAA AVHRR) estimates of leaf area index (LAI) as part of the Boreal Ecosystem Atmosphere Study (BOREAS). We demonstrate that boreal forests will continue to provide a substantial 'brake' on the rate of increase in atmospheric CO2, provided anthropogenic emissions reduce dramatically to within the limits of the 'Kyoto Protocol'. However, if anthropogenic emissions follow the unmitigated scenario (i.e. 'business as usual'), carbon sequestration will increase to a maximum by around 2050 but thereafter collapse, resulting in a disappearance of the boreal carbon sink by around 2080. An ESM and remotely sensed data was a viable predictive tool for the study of carbon sequestration over land and has potential as an aid for policy and management decisions.",,"Carbon; Carbon dioxide; Computer simulation; Ecosystems; Remote sensing; Carbon sequestration; Forestry; boreal forest; carbon sequestration; carbon sink; climate change; data processing; remote sensing","Natural Environment Research Council, NERC","This work was funded by the NERC.

The task would be impossible without space-based Earth observation, which allows the rapid generation of extensive data sets describing land surface properties. It is the task of remote sensing scientists to interpret these data into a meaningful source of forest information. Here, a fast and easily automated method for classifying boreal forests in terms of growing stock volume is presented. The work was conducted as part of the SIBERIA project, which has resulted in the recent publication of a map of forest growing stock volume covering 900 000 km2 in Central Siberia.

It was used for estimating soil organic C densities for various forest types for two-depth classes (0-50 and 0-100 cm). The mean soil organic C density estimates for top 50 cm based on 175 observations ranged from 37.5 t/ha in tropical dry deciduous forest to 92.1 t/ha in littoral and swamp forest. The mean soil organic C density estimates based on 136 observations ranged from 70 t/ha in tropical dry deciduous forest to 162 t/ha in montane temperate forest for top 1 m soil depth. The estimated soil organic C densities were combined with remote sensing based recent forest area inventory (64.20 Mha) by Forest Survey of India [The State of Forest Report, Forest Survey of India (FSI), Ministry of Environment and Forest, Govt. of India, Dehradun, 80 pp.] to arrive at estimates of soil organic C pool by major forest types of India.

The historic loss in forest soil organic C pool (1880-1981) in top 1 m soil depth has been estimated as 4.13 PgC.

The procedures were originally designed for application in Canada with AVHRR data aboard the NOAA 14 satellite. They were tested here with both NOAA 11 and NOAA 14 covering the period 1989-2000. It was found that the active fire detection algorithm performs well with low commission and omission error rates over forested regions in the absence of cloud cover. Moderate errors were found over semi-arid areas covered by thin clouds, as well as along rivers and around lakes observed from sun-glint angles. A modification to a fire algorithm threshold and the addition of a new test can significantly improve the detection accuracy. Burned areas mapped by satellite were compared against extensive fire polygon data acquired by U.S. forest agencies in five western states. The satellite-based mapping matches nearly 90% of total forested burned area, with the difference being mainly attributable to omission of some nonburned islands and patches within the fire polygons. In addition, it maps a significant area of burning outside the fire polygons that appear to be true fires. The 10% omission error was found to be caused mainly by three factors: lack or insufficient number of active fires, partial burning, and vegetation recovery after early season burning. In addition to total area, the location and shapes of burned scars are consistent with the ground-based maps. Overall, the two algorithms are competent for detecting and mapping forest fires in North America north of Mexico with minor modifications.","Biomass burning; Carbon budget; Climate change; Forest fire; Remote sensing","algorithm; fire; mapping; performance assessment; satellite imagery",,,,,,,,,,,,"Li, Z.; Earth System Sci.

The effects of the interannual changes in measured background temperatures, caused by the orbital drift of the afternoon NOAA satellites and by environmental factors, are investigated. Background temperature changes are analyzed using a time series of monthly mean clear-sky brightness temperatures from the NOAA National Environmental Satellite, Data, and Information Service (NESDIS) Pathfinder Atmosphere (PATMOS) data set at a 1° × 1° resolution. Examples of target areas over four predominant land cover types, as defined in the International Geosphere-Biosphere Programme (IGBP) global 1 km data set, are presented. The results indicate that over forests (defined as >60% tree canopy cover) the contrast between nonburning background and fire pixels is nearly always sufficient for successful fire detection. Over nonforested areas, however, the low saturation temperature of the mid-IR channel on the NOAA 7 to NOAA 14 satellites often sets a physical limit to the separation of valid fire pixels and false ones. Moreover, the severity of this effect changes over the years with the changing background temperatures. The results suggest that because of the potential spurious trends in the number of fires, nonforested areas be excluded from the multiyear analysis. However, a detailed assessment of the emissions from nonforest fires is needed to quantify the effect of this on continental-scale emission estimates.","AVHRR; Biomass burning; Interannual variability; Satellite fire detection","annual variation; fire; radiometer; remote sensing; North America",,,,,,,,,,,,"Csiszar, I.; Department of Geography, 1121 LeFrak Hall, College Park, MD 20742, United States; email: icsiszar@hermes.geog.umd.edu",,"Blackwell Publishing Ltd",01480227,,,,"English","J.

Along the vertical profile of vegetation, horizontal slices of probability of light transmittance were derived from an Optech ALTM 1225 instrument’s return pulses (two discrete, 15-cm diameter returns) using indicator kriging. These predictions were compared with (i) below canopy (1-cm spatial resolution) transect measurements of the fraction of photosynthetically active radiation (FPAR) and (ii) measurementsof tree height. A first-order trend was initally removed from the lidar returns. The vertical distribution of vegetation height was then sliced into nine percentiles and indicator variograms were fitted to them. Variogram parameters were found to vary as a function of foliage height above ground. In this paper, we show that the relationship between ground measurements of FPAR and kriged estimates of vegetation cover becomes stronger and tighter at coarser spatial resolutions. Three-dimensional maps of foliage distribution were computed as stacks of the percentile probability surfaces. These probability surfaces showed correspondence with individual treebasedobservations and provided a much more detailed characterization of quasi-continuous foliage distribution. These results suggest that discrete-return lidar provides a promising technology to capture variations of foliage characteristics in forests to support the development of functional linkages between biophysical and ecological studies. © 2003, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

This has been mostly done by detecting differences in a time series of high resolution data. However, the interpretation of the images and the detection of change is cumbersome and expensive. Furthermore, the area covered by a high resolution image is relatively small and only available on a monthly bases. This work investigates if detected fire of the low resolution (AVHRR) sensor can be used as a quick and inexpensive way of locating areas of rapid forest cover change. It tests the hypothesis that vegetation fires, as detected by earth orbiting satellites, are a reliable indicator of ""hot spots"" of deforestation in tropical South America. Fine spatial resolution satellite data were used to measure the deforestation that occurred in the mid 1990s in 41 sites spread across the tropical forests of South America. These data were then compared to the number of fires occurring in these sites, as detected by the NOAA-AVHRR satellite between April 1992 and December 1993. At the individual site level, 25 of the test sites showed a significant statistical relationship between the fires and the deforestation occurring in the following years. A further 6 sites showed neither fire activity nor significant deforestation. When aggregated to the regional level, only the set of sites lying in relatively dry areas with the same land use practices (located in Brazil) showed a significant correlation between fire and deforestation. This correlation enabled us to produce a map of high deforestation risk occurring in 1992 in the Brazilian Amazon, which showed close correspondence to the actual deforestation fronts of the year 1992. © 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

LAI can be estimated using algorithms applied to airborne and satellite imagery, with ground-based measurements of LAI being required for calibration and validation. A variety of methods exist for ground-based and remote estimation of LAI, and this can lead to confusion and uncertainty regarding selection of methods, experimental design, and instrumentation. As a contribution towards clarifying these protocols, this paper investigated and compared three optical methods and an allometric technique for ground-based estimation of LAI, and these were related to remote LAI estimates derived from the compact airborne spectrographic imager (casi) using three vegetation indices (normalized difference, weighted difference, and soil-adjusted vegetation indices, or NDVI, WDVI, and SAVI, respectively) and subpixel-scale spectral mixture analysis (SMA). The study was conducted in the Kananaskis region of Alberta in the Canadian Rocky Mountains and considered four species compositions within a montane ecological subregion: lodgepole pine, white spruce, composite deciduous (aspen and balsam poplar), and mixedwood (mixture of deciduous and lodgepole pine or white spruce). LAI data were obtained in the field using a LI-COR, Inc. LAI-2000 instrument, a tracing radiation and architecture of canopies (TRAC) system, an integrated (LAI-2000 and TRAC) method, and an allometric technique that used the ratio of sapwood basal area to leaf area. A subsample of plots was assessed with hemispherical photographs and LAI-2000 data from which similar effective leaf area index (eLAI) values were derived for two of the four species analyzed. The results highlight the importance of ensuring that samples represent the range of stand structures and canopy architecture inherent in the species group being assessed. Foliage clumping was observed to be similar in both coniferous and deciduous species and an important element to measure. LAI estimates were influenced by the field methods used to estimate LAI, species and their canopy architecture, and the form of the vegetation index or subpixel-scale mixing derived from the casi image. Of the three vegetation indices, the SAVI was the statistically strongest predictor of LAI for mixedwood species, but all were poor LAI estimators for lodgepole pine and deciduous species. The subpixel-scale scene fractions from SMA provided the best prediction of LAI for white spruce compared with the three vegetation indices. The result for white spruce provides an encouraging basis for further investigation of SMA as a sampling tool to scale from field to high-resolution airborne and satellite imagery for local to landscape-level biophysical estimation. © 2003, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

However, sampling of the biomass can be expensive, time-consuming, and difficult depending on the nature of field conditions. Instead of directly estimating the biomass from the satellite data when the sample size is small, it is intended to estimate the biomass of the mountainous tropical forest in Kinabalu Park, Sabah, Malaysia, using the well-established biophysical relationship between crown diameter and biomass. Landsat thematic mapper (TM) data are corrected for geometric distortion and are georeferenced to facilitate satellite data extraction. Path radiance for atmospheric correction is derived using the histogram method, and the Minnaert correction approach is employed to correct for topographic effects. Correlation and regression analyses are carried out with the six original bands and several derived satellite variables (several vegetation indices, tasseled cap transformation variables, and coefficients of pattern decomposition). When the sample size of the biomass is small, estimation using a biophysical relationship between the biomass and other structural variable such as crown diameter is more appropriate and reliable. Owing to biomass data availability, the biophysical relationship between biomass and crown diameter can only be established for closed forest. The closed forest is distinguished using percent crown cover, which is estimated from the wetness indicator. Under the closed forest condition, a significant inverse correlation between band 1 and crown diameter is found. Using the biophysical relationship, biomass is then estimated from crown diameter, which is estimated from band 1. © 2003, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

Indirect measurements using radiation transmittance and gap fraction theory are often compared and calibrated against litter fall, which is considered as a reference method, but few studies address the question of litter specific leaf area (SLA) measurement and variability. SLA (leaf area per unit of dry weight, m2·g‐1) is used to convert dry leaf litter biomass (g·m‐2) into leaf area per ground unit area (m2·m‐2). We paid special attention to this parameter in two young beech stands (dense and thinned) in northeastern France. The variability of both canopy (closure, LAI) and site conditions (soil properties, vegetation) was investigated as potential contributing factors to beech SLA variability. A systematic description of soil and floristic composition was performed and three types of soil were identified. Ellenberg's indicator values were averaged for each plot to assess nitrogen soil content. SLA of beech litter was measured three times during the fall in 23 plots in the stands (40 ha). Litter was collected bimonthly in square-shaped traps (0.5 m2) and dried. Before drying, 30 leaves per plot and for each date were sampled, and leaf length, width, and area were measured with the help of a LI-COR areameter. SLA was calculated as the ratio of cumulated leaf area to total dry weight of the 30 leaves. Leaves characteristics per plot were averaged for the three dates of litter collection. Plant area index (PAI), estimated using the LAI-2000 plant canopy analyser and considering only the upper three rings, ranged from 2.9 to 8.1. Specific leaf area of beech litter was also highly different from one plot to the other, ranging from 150 to 320 cm2·g‐1. Nevertheless, no relationship was found between SLA and stand canopy closure or PAI. On the contrary, a significant relationship between SLA and soil properties was observed. Both SLA and leaf area had the lowest values in the most hydromorphic soil with the highest nitrogen content. On the other hand, the highest values of SLA and leaf area were observed on the plots with the lowest nitrogen content. This spatial variability of SLA was taken into account to estimate LAI from litter collected at eight plots. For our study site, we conclude that neglecting SLA spatial variability is at the source of 8‐24% error in the calculation of LAI. © 2003, Taylor &amp; Francis Group, LLC.

In addition, the study explored the importance of the lidar-derived crown diameter for estimating tree volume and biomass. The lidar dataset was acquired over deciduous, coniferous, and mixed stands of varying age classes and settings typicalof the southeastern United States. For identifying individual trees, lidar processing techniques used data fusion with multispectral optical data and local filtering with both square and circular windows of variable size. The crown diameter was calculatedas the average of two values measured along two perpendicular directions from the location of each tree top by fitting a fourth-degree polynomial on both profiles.The lidar-derived tree measurements were used with regression models and cross-validation to estimate plot level field-measured crown diameter. Linear regression was also used to compare plot level tree volume and biomass estimation with and without lidar-derived crown diameter measures from individual trees. Results for estimating crown diameter were similar for both pines and deciduous trees, with R2 values of 0.62–0.63 for the dominant trees(root mean square error (RMSE) 1.36 to 1.41 m). Lidar-measured crown diameter improved R2 values for volume and biomass estimation byup to 0.25 for both pines and deciduous plots (RMSE improved byup to 8 m3/ha for volume and 7 Mg/ha for biomass). For the pine plots, average crown diameter alone explained 78% of the varianceassociated with biomass (RMSE 31.8Mg/ha) and 83% of the variancefor volume (RMSE 47.90 m3/ha). © 2003, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

A selected case during summer 2001 is presented, when very high aerosol optical depth values were observed, benefiting from the synergy of various remote sensing instruments. The data that were collected allow the characterization of the optical properties of the aerosols in this region, where only little information has so far been available. Four-day back trajectories indicated that air masses were advected from Bulgaria and the northern coast of the Black Sea, where strong forest fires occurred in early August 2001. In order to investigate the optical properties of biomass burning aerosols, we used a two-wavelength lidar system that combines Raman and elastic-backscatter observations, in addition to a Brewer spectrophotometer, a nephelometer and a multi-filter rotating shadowband radiometer. The lidar measurements on 9 August 2001 recorded an integrated aerosol optical depth at 355nm of the order of 1.35 during cloud-free conditions. The estimated mean extinction-to-backscatter ratios from the Raman lidar were 60sr for 355nm and 50sr for 532nm. Estimated values of the single scattering albedo, using spectral UV measurements and modeling were of the order of 0.90, consistent with previous findings, indicating a weak contribution of absorption to the total extinction. The Angstrom exponent, calculated from the multi-filter rotating shadowband radiometer exhibited also high values around 1.78, indicating the presence of rather small particles. © 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

Kyoto protocol to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) has emphasized on the complimentary use of remotely sensed information for meeting some of the obligations under the Protocol. For undertaking regional and continental scale assessment of resources and other phenomena that facilitate better understanding and modelling of the carbon cycle, mosaics encompassing thousands of image scenes from space-borne radar satellites have been generated over different regions and are being exploited by the research community for varied purposes. There have been large uncertainties in global carbon budget mainly due to the inaccurate characterization of the forest changes, particularly in the.tropics. Exploiting the radar remote sensing for biomass estimation and ""deforestation mapping in Southeast Asian tropical forests, it has been shown that radar has a tremendous potential for facilitating monitoring of anthropogenic changes and biomass production. The better characterization of the rate of change of the biomass and anthropogenic influences on forest cover would enhance the reliability of model estimates of the global Carbon cycle.

We examined how forest species types in northern Wisconsin affect landscape scale water fluxes predicted from models driven by remotely sensed forest classification. A site-specific classification was developed for the study site. Using this information and a digital soils database produced for the site we identified four key forest stand types: red pine, northern hardwoods, aspen, and forested wetland. Within these stand types, 64 trees representing 7 species were continuously monitored with sap flux sensors. Scaled stand-level transpiration from sap flux was combined with a two-source soil evaporation model and then applied over a 2.5 km × 3.0 km area around the WLEF AmeriFlux tower (Park Falls, Wisconsin) to estimate evapotranspiration. Water flux data at the tower was used as a check against these estimates. Then, experiments were conducted to determine the effects of aggregating vegetation types to International Geosphere- Biosphere Program (IGBP) level on water flux predictions. Taxonomic aggregation resulting in loss of species level information significantly altered landscape water flux predictions. However, daily water fluxes were not significantly affected by spatial aggregation when forested wetland evaporation was included. The results demonstrate the importance of aspen, which has a higher transpiration rate per unit leaf area than other forest species. However, more significant uncertainty results from not including forested wetland with its high rates of evaporation during wet summers.","Eddy covariance; Evapotranspiration; Forested landscapes; Hydrology; Remote sensing; Sap flux; Spatial aggregation; Vegetation classification","evapotranspiration; forest management; prediction; vegetation classification; United States; Pinus resinosa",,,,,,,,,,,,"Mackay, D.S.; Department of Forest Ecology/Mgmt., 1630 Linden Dr., Madison, WI 53706, United States; email: dsmackay@facstaff.wisc.edu",,,13541013,,,,"English","Global Change Biol.",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0036889576

District-level forest phytomass C (1988, 1994) was computed by combining remote sensing-based forest area inventories on 1:250 000 scale, field inventories of growing stock volume by the Forest Survey of India (FSI), and crown density-based biomass expansion factors. The estimates of forest area inventory, forest phytomass C density, and forest phytomass C pools (1988-94) were linked to the district boundary coverage of India in ARC/INFO Geographic Information System (GIS). Of the total 386 districts examined, only 17 districts had more than 75% forest cover (as percent of their geographic area) in 1988. Estimated district-level forest phytomass C densities ranged from 4.3 to 206.8 MgC ha-1*. At the national level, forest phytomass C pool was estimated to be 3871.2 and 3874.3 TgC# in 1988 and 1994, respectively. Although the aggregated national estimates were similar, the district-level change analysis indicated a decrease of 77.8 TgC and an increase of 81 TgC (1988-94). The highest decrease of 10.4 TgC was observed in Vishakapatnam district (Andhra Pradesh) while largest increase of 9.8 TgC in Bastar district (Madhya Pradesh) resulting from deforestation and afforestation activities, respectively. At the national level, the total forest cover decreased by ∼0.6 Mha, however, the district-level spatial analysis indicated an increase of 1.07 Mha, and decrease of 1.65 Mha forest cover during 1988-94 period. Although, this is the first district level phytomass C analysis of Indian forests, the aggregated results at state-level were close to the earlier estimates. The spatial analysis identified the districts that have undergone significant changes in their forest phytomass C during the study period. This improved understanding of forest phytomass C pools is important to sustainable development and conservation of forests, mitigation strategies for C sequestration, and accurate estimation of contribution of land use changes to C emission in India.","Forest growing stock; Forest inventory; Forest phytomass carbon density; Geographic information system; India; Remote sensing","carbon; forest ecosystem; phytomass; spatial distribution; India",,,,,,,,,,,,"Dadhwal, V.K.; Remote Sensing Applications Area, , Ahmedabad, 380 015, India; email: dadhwalvk@hotmail.com",,,13541013,,,,"English","Global Change Biol.",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0036889519

This paper presents the results of the application of the C-Fix model within the frame of part of the objectives of the LTEEF-II project, as defined for the European continental scale. A description of the C-Fix model is presented in the first part of this paper. C-Fix is a Monteith type parametric model driven by temperature, radiation and fraction of Absorbed Photosynthetically Active Radiation (fAPAR), the last variable derived by processing NOAA/AVHRR data of 1997 acquired over Europe as well as VEGETATION (VGT) data for the same region for the period 1998-1999. In a second part of the paper, the main results obtained are described, e.g. net ecosystem fluxes for forest, calculated locally for the Euroflux CO2 measurement sites as well as for the whole continent. The model simulations were evaluated with eddy covariance measurements of NEP performed during 1997 at the Euroflux sites. Moreover, a comparison between NEP determined with NOAA/AVHRR data, opposed to NEP simulations based on VGT data is performed. A difference up to 20% is obtained between both data sets. Finally A C-Fix estimate of total European vegetation NEP obtained with NOAA/AVHRR data for 1997 is 2.70 ± 32% Pg C, (P= 1015 g, % is 95% confidence limit). This estimate decreases to 2.15 ± 43% Pg C when VGT data for the period April 1998 - March 1999 are used. The total forest NEP for Europe, however, is estimated at 0.735 Pg C for 1997. Along a North - South transect at 13° east, through Europe a clear increase in NEP and the other basic carbon mass fluxes GPP and NPP is modelled from northern to southern latitudes. Moreover, along this transect the values simulated with C-Fix for NEP corresponds well with the eddy covariance NEP estimates for the Euroflux sites. © 2002 Published by Elsevier Science Inc.",,"Carbon; Climate change; Computer simulation; Ecosystems; Fluxes; Forestry; Vegetation; Covariance measurements; Remote sensing; atmosphere-biosphere interaction; carbon flux; climate change; estimation method; forest; remote sensing; Europe","ENV4-CT97-0577","This study was funded by the EC Fourth Framework Program on Environment and Climate Change ‘LTEEF’ (Contract ENV4-CT97-0577).

They play a critical role in Russia's economy and in stabilizing the global climate. The boreal forests of central and western Siberia represent the largest unbroken tracts of forest in the world. The European Commission funded SIBERIA project aimed at producing a forest map covering an area of 1.2 million square kilometres. Three synthetic aperture radars (SAR) on board the European remote sensing satellites ERS-1 and ERS-2 and the Japanese Earth resources satellite JERS-1 were used to collect remote sensing data. Radar is the only sensor capable of penetrating cloud cover and imaging at night. An adaptive, model-based, contextual classification to derive ranked total growing stock volume classes suitable for large-scale mapping is described. The accuracy assessment of the Siberian forest cover map is presented. The weighted coefficient of agreement κw is calculated to quantify the agreement between the classified map and the reference data. First, the classified map is compared with Russian forest inventory data (κw = 0.72). The inherent uncertainty in the forest inventory data is simulated by allowing for fuzziness. The effect of uncertainty on the unweighted coefficient of agreement κ is stronger than that on the weighted coefficient of agreement κw. Second, the map is compared with a more reliable, independent posterior ground survey by Russian forestry experts (κw = 0.94).

This may be achieved by driving ecosystem simulation models (ESMs) spatially with remotely sensed estimates of ecological variables, such as leaf area index (LAI). Conventional procedures for analysing digital remotely sensed images rely upon pixel-based methods, using spectral information from each pixel to allocate it to a land cover type or estimate a surface property (e.g. LAI). Groups of pixels, within areas assumed to be 'thematically homogeneous', will not necessarily provide the same allocation or estimation due to data noise, atmospheric effects and natural variation of the surface. Pixels on the boundary between areas are an additional problem as their spectral information derives from more than one surface type. If contextual information on the spatial pattern and structure of the landscape could be included in the analysis (e.g. forest inventory polygons, agricultural land parcels), then the accuracy of the allocations or estimations (e.g. of LAI) could be increased. Polygon-based approaches, where all pixels within a defined area are presumed similar and so can be combined prior to analysis, offer a solution. These approaches are implemented most efficiently within an integrated GIS where raster and ancillary data can be analysed with reference to vector land polygons. A procedure using remotely sensed data in a polygon format to produce accurate spatial estimates of LAI (on which to drive an ESM) is described. In relation to a pixel-based procedure, the polygon-based procedure provided: (1) increased accuracy, (2) more appropriate and realistic representations of the environment and (3) a powerful and flexible framework for further data analysis. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

Such atmospheric CO2 concentrations results from the combination of connective boundary layer dynamics, synoptic events, large-scale transport of CO2, and regional surface fluxes and depend on the variability of these processes in time and space. In this paper we investigate the spatial and temporal variability of the land surface CO2 fluxes derived from the TURC model. This productivity model is driven by satellite NDVI and forced by ECMWF or REMO meteorology. We first present an analysis of recent CO2 flux measurements over temperature and boreal forests, which are used to update the TURC model. A strong linear relationship has been found between maximum hourly CO2 fluxes and the mean annual air temperature, showing that boreal biomes have a lower photosynthetic capacity than temperate ones. Then, model input consistency and simulated CO2 flux accuracy are evaluated against local measurements from two sites in Russia. Finally, the spatial and temporal patterns of the daily CO2 fluxes over Eurasia are analysed. We show that, during the growing season (spring and summer), the daily CO2 fluxes display characteristics spatial patterns of positive and negative fluxes at the synoptic scale. These patterns are found to correspond to cloudy areas (areas with low incoming radiation) and to follow the motion of cloud cover areas over the whole domain. As a consequence, we argue that covariations of surface CO2 fluxes and atmospheric transport at the synoptic scale may impact CO2 concentrations over continents and need to be investigated.",,"boreal forest; carbon balance; carbon cycle; carbon flux; remote sensing; temperate forest; Eurasia",,,,,,,,,,,,"Lafont, S.; CESBIO (CNRS/CNES/UPS), 18 av.

The capabilities of the MODIS sensor of NASA's Terra and Aqua platforms, in observing the terrestrial environment, are a precursor to the operational capabilities of the National Polar Operational Environmental Satellite System (NPOESS) series of missions, which will succeed the current polar operational capabilities of the NOAA series of satellites. Prior to NPOESS, the NPOESS Preparatory Project (NPP) will be launched, acting as a bridge between the two MODIS instruments and the longer term advanced operational capability. The result of these missions will be the establishment of long-term systematic, operational capabilities. Notwithstanding the improvements arising from these missions, there are many lessons to be learnt from current experiences in using MODIS data. Moreover, the timing of the implementation of these missions will provide challenges to users.

Two MODIS vegetation indices (VI), the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and enhanced vegetation index (EVI), are produced at 1-km and 500-m resolutions and 16-day compositing periods. This paper presents an initial analysis of the MODIS NDVI and EVI performance from both radiometric and biophysical perspectives. We utilize a combination of site-intensive and regionally extensive approaches to demonstrate the performance and validity of the two indices. Our results showed a good correspondence between airborne-measured, top-of-canopy reflectances and VI values with those from the MODIS sensor at four intensively measured test sites representing semi-arid grass/shrub, savanna, and tropical forest biomes. Simultaneously derived field biophysical measures also demonstrated the scientific utility of the MODIS VI. Multitemporal profiles of the MODIS VIs over numerous biome types in North and South America well represented their seasonal phenologies. Comparisons of the MODIS-NDVI with the NOAA-14, 1-km AVHRR-NDVI temporal profiles showed that the MODIS-based index performed with higher fidelity. The dynamic range of the MODIS VIs are presented and their sensitivities in discriminating vegetation differences are evaluated in sparse and dense vegetation areas. We found the NDVI to asymptotically saturate in high biomass regions such as in the Amazon while the EVI remained sensitive to canopy variations. © 2002 Elsevier Science Inc.

The objectives are biomass estimation, forest and land-cover-type recognition in boreal forests. A new adaptive inversion method for active sensors was developed for the forest block-wise stem volume estimation from satelliteborne radar images (e.g. JERS-1, ERS-1 SAR and RADARSAT). The inversion results with L-band and/or C-band synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images showed promising accuracies: the relative retrieval rms error varied from 25% to 5% as the size of the forest area varied from 5 to 30000 h (the forest stem volume varied from 0 to 300 m3/ha). The textural information of a seasonal set of satelliteborne radar images was studied with the first- and second-order statistical measures. The multitemporal approach was beneficial for the textural measures in forest and land-cover-type recognition. Based on the SAR image texture, the overall classification accuracy for seven land-cover types was 65%, while with the SAR image intensity, the classification accuracy was 50%, respectively. In the forest-type classification based on the SAR image texture and intensity, the overall classification accuracy for four forest types was 66%, while with the intensity alone the accuracy was 40%, respectively. With the passive microwave sensor (e.g. satelliteborne SSM/I radiometer), the mixed pixel approach was employed for stem volume (biomass) and forest coverage fraction estimation. The results obtained, show that the pixel-wise fractions of water, non-forested, and forested area can be estimated with a rms errors of around 10% units. A new stem volume inversion method for wintertime SSM/I data achieved promising accuracies, the rms error was from 13 to 19 m3/ha/pixel (25 km × 25 km) which was 15-16% of the mean stem volume. In the test area, the stem volume ranged from 40 to 160 m3/ha/pixel. © 2002 International Astronautical Federation. Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.

We estimate fluxes for the 1980s and 1990s using subpixel estimates of percent tree cover derived from coarse (National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer) satellite data in combination with a terrestrial carbon model. The satellite-derived estimates of change in forest area are lower than national reports and remote-sensing surveys from the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization Forest Resource Assessment (FRA) in all tropical regions, especially for the 1980s. However, our results indicate that the net rate of tropical forest clearing increased ≈10% from the 1980s to 1990s, most notably in southeast Asia, in contrast to an 11 % reduction reported by the FRA. We estimate net mean annual carbon fluxes from tropical deforestation and regrowth to average 0.6 (0.3-0.8) and 0.9 (0.5-1.4) petagrams (Pg)·yr-1 for the 1980s and 1990s, respectively.

It complements the experimental and theoretical study of closed canopies presented in the previous papers by analysing two different mangrove stands of equal biomass but which greatly differ in their structure. For the three considered frequencies (C-, L- and P-band), experimental observations show that the backscattering from the open declining stand is higher than that of the closed forest. The corresponding enhancement factor increases with wavelength and shows maximum values for the HH polarization. The identification of the scattering mechanisms occurring between the incident radar wave and the forest components was performed with the assistance of a polarimetric scattering model based on a radiative transfer approach. For the co-polarizations, results of the simulation study confirm that the backscatter enhancement is mainly due to an increase of either the surface scattering or the interaction component. For the cross-polarization HV at L- and P-bands, the increase of the volume component, originating from a stronger interaction with bigger branches, is found to be responsible for the observed enhancement. These findings confirm the large effect of the canopy structure on the forest backscatter and give rise to two important applications. First, the mapping of open declining mangrove stands appears feasible by using either the backscattering coefficient values, especially at P-HH and P-HV, or the HH-VV phase difference at P-band. Second, the use of the σ°-biomass statistical relationships must be restricted to homogeneous closed canopies.",,"Backscattering; Biomass; Computer simulation; Polarimeters; Polarization; Radar; Canopy structures; Forestry; backscatter; canopy architecture; forest canopy; mangrove; radar; radiative transfer; remote sensing; French Guiana",,,,,,,,,,,,"Proisy, C.; Inst. de Recherche pour le Dev., Route de Montabo, Cayenne cedex 97323, France; email: proisy@cayenne.ind.fr",,"Taylor and Francis Ltd.",01431161,,IJSED,,"English","Int.

It is of interest to the public, foresters, environmental organizations, and governments, yet it is difficult to obtain reliable estimates of its extent and nature. Climate change and the role of forests has given a large impetus for formalizing reporting on deforestation. Under the proposed Kyoto Protocol, industrialized nations are required to report on the carbon consequences of deforestation and include them in their greenhouse gas emissions accounting. Canada must develop measurement systems to report on the area of deforestation and the carbon stock loss. Possible data sources include the new plot-based National Forest Inventory (NFI), land use records, and satellite remote sensing. The NFI is a network of 2 × 2 km plots at a 20 km spacing for which land cover and stand attributes are interpreted from medium-scale aerial photography. In this study, medium-resolution satellite imagery, such as Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM), was explored as a potential tool for deforestation estimation and a survey of available land use records was conducted. Factors affecting the utility of each data source and various system design options were examined. An integrated system is suggested that utilizes the NFI as a base, augmented by satellite remote sensing plots and supported by local records as appropriate. © 2002, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

The resulting combustion of large amounts of biomass not only transforms forest vegetation, but it also creates significant carbon emissions that total, according to some authors, from 35-94 Mt C per year. These carbon emissions from forest fires should be considered an important part of the forest ecosystem carbon balance and a significant influence on atmospheric trace gases. In this paper we discuss a new method to assess forest fire damage. This method is based on using multi-spectral high-resolution satellite images, large-scale aerial photography, and declassified images obtained from the space-borne national security systems. A normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) difference image was produced from pre- and post-fire satellite images from SPOT/HRVIR and RESURS-O/MSU-E images. A close relationship was found between values of the NDVI difference image and forest damage level. High-resolution satellite data and large-scale aerial-photos were used to calibrate the NDVI-derived forest damage map. The method was used for mapping of forest fire extent and damage and for estimating carbon emissions from burned forest areas.",,"Aerial photography; Biomass; Carbon; Fires; Particulate emissions; Remote sensing; Vegetation; Fire damages; Forest fires; Forestry; biogenic emission; carbon cycle; forest fire; remote sensing; wildfire",,,,,,,,,,,,"Isaev, A.S.; Ctr.

J. Andrews Forest in the western Cascade Range of Oregon, established as an Experimental Forest in 1948 by the U.S. Forest Service and a National Science Foundation (NSF) long-term ecological research (LTER) site since 1980. It is located at 44.2 N, 122.2 W and occupies the 6400-ha drainage basin of Lookout Creek, a tributary of the Blue River and the McKenzie River. It is representative of the rugged mountainous landscape of the Pacific Northwest (Fig. 1) with elevations in the range of 410–1630 m and with many of the region’s conifer forest types (Fig. 2), wildlife, and stream ecosystems. The primary conifers in and around the Andrews forest are Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga) and western hemlock (Tsuga heterophylla) [27]. The area has wet, mild winters and dry, cool summers with average annual precipitation between 230 cm at the base to over 355 cm at higher elevations. Before timber cutting began in 1950, about 65% of the virgin Andrews Forest was in old-growth forest (400–500 years old), and the remainder was largely in stands developed after wildfires in the mid-1800s to early 1900s. Clearcutting and shelterwood cuttings over about 30% of the H. J. Andrews Forest have created young plantation forests varying in composition, stocking level, and age. Old-growth forest stands with dominant trees over 400 years old still cover about 40% of the area, with LAI values up to 8 m /m , heights of up to 80 m, and biomass values of 500–1000 tons/ha [3], [28], [29]. Mature stands (100 to 200 years old) originating from wildfire cover about 20%.",,,,,,,,,"Moghaddam, M.; Jet Propulsion Laboratory, , Pasadena, CA 91109, United States; email: mahta.moghaddam@jpl.nasa.gov",,,01962892,,IGRSD,,"English","IEEE Trans Geosci Remote Sens",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0036822004

Fire burns large areas annually, much of it in low-severity surface fires - but data on fire area and impacts or extent of varying fire severity are poor. Changes in land use, cover, and disturbance patterns such as those predicted by global climate change models, have the potential to greatly alter current fire regimes in boreal forests and to significantly impact global carbon budgets. The extent and global importance of fires in the boreal zone have often been greatly underestimated. For the 1998 fire season we estimate from remote sensing data that about 13.3 million ha burned in Siberia. This is about 5 times higher than estimates from the Russian Aerial Forest Protection Service (Avialesookhrana) for the same period. We estimate that fires in the Russian boreal forest in 1998 constituted some 14-20% of average annual global carbon emissions from forest fires. Average annual emissions from boreal zone forests may be equivalent to 23-39% of regional fossil fuel emissions in Canada and Russia, respectively. But the lack of accurate data and models introduces large potential errors into these estimates. Improved monitoring and understanding of the landscape extent and severity of fires and effects of fire on carbon storage, air chemistry, vegetation dynamics and structure, and forest health and productivity are essential to provide inputs into global and regional models of carbon cycling and atmospheric chemistry.",,"Atmospheric chemistry; Biomass; Carbon; Climate change; Environmental protection; Fires; Land use; Particulate emissions; Remote sensing; Soils; Vegetation; Forest fires; Forestry; carbon cycle; emission; forest fire; Russian Federation",,,,,,,,,,,,"Conard, S.G.; USDA Forest Service, Washington, D.C. 20250, United States",,,01650009,,CLCHD,,"English","Clim.

As the VGT sensor has a short-wave infrared (SWIR) band that is sensitive to vegetation, soil moisture and leaf water content, the Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI) was calculated in addition to the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI). A forest map of Northeast China was generated from an unsupervised classification of 25 10-day VGT composite data (NDVI and NDWI) over the period of March 11-20, 1999 to November 11-20, 1999. Seven different forest categories were distinguished from the 1-km spatial resolution VGT data. The VGT forest map was compared to estimates of forest area derived from Landsat 7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper (ETM+) images. There was a good agreement on spatial distribution and area of forest between the VGT product and the TM product, however, the VGT product provided additional information on forest type. Analysis of NDVI and NDWI over the plant growing season allows for the identification of distinct growth patterns between the different forest types. It is evident that VGT data can be used to provide timely and detailed forest maps with limited ancillary data needed. The VGT-derived forest maps could be very useful as input to biogeochemical models (particularly carbon cycle models) that require timely estimates of forest area and type. © 2002 Published by Elsevier Science Inc.",,"Biochemistry; Forestry; Moisture; Plants (botany); Soils; Vegetation; Normalized difference water index (NDWE); Remote sensing; forest; Landsat thematic mapper; NDVI; SPOT; unsupervised classification; China","National Aeronautics and Space Administration, NASA: NAG5-10135, NAG5-7631, NAG5-6137; NAG5-11160","This study was supported by the NASA Earth Observing System (EOS) interdisciplinary science program (NAG5-6137, NAG5-10135), the NASA Terrestrial Ecology program (NAG5-7631), and the NASA Land Use and Land Cover Change program (NAG5-11160).

Terrestrial vegetation plays a significant role in the global carbon cycle and management actions that increase carbon stocks in vegetation and soils could potentially offset CO2 emissions from use of fossil fuels. Inclusion of such actions in international climate agreements has been controversial. The Kyoto Protocol allowed for a limited set of vegetation 'sink' activities to be accounted toward greenhouse-gas mitigation targets in the first commitment period and rules regarding implementation of these activities have recently been agreed. Inclusion of carbon in vegetation sinks in the Kyoto Protocol has focused policy attention on the need for better understanding and monitoring of carbon dynamics in terrestrial ecosystems. Recent investment in remote sensing, modelling and accounting systems has improved capacity to assess and report on carbon fluxes in vegetation, particularly those associated with recent land-cover change from forest to non-forest and vice versa. Quantitative understanding of carbon dynamics across the broader vegetation estate remains limited. Future challenges for a comprehensive assessment of carbon cycling in vegetation include quantification of the effects of changes in vegetation structure from historical changes in fire and grazing regimes, the impact of human and natural wildfire and the area and growth of regrowth forest created by past clearing and timber harvesting. Different reporting processes will require separation of the effects of human-induced versus natural processes.

An estimation of the extension of burnt areas is also required in order to quantify NBP (net biome productivity), a variable that includes large-scale carbon losses (such as fire) bypassing heterotrophic respiration. Hence, eddy covariance measurements of CO2 and water vapour were carried out in a natural regenerating forest after a fire event. Measurements were collected continuously over a Betula spp. stand in central Siberia during summer 1999. Minimum carbon exchange rate (NEE, net ecosystem exchange) exceeded -30 μmol m-2 s-1 (net flux negative indicating CO2 uptake by vegetation) and the partitioning of the available energy was mostly dominated by latent heat flux. Structure, age and composition of the forest were analysed to understand the secondary succession stages. The results were compared with previous studies on coniferous forests where biospheric exchanges of energy were dominated by sensible heat fluxes and small carbon uptake rotes, thus indicating rather limiting growing conditions. A classification of a Landsat-4 Thematic Mapper scene has been carried out to determine the magnitude of burnt areas and the extension of broadleaf regenerating forests. Analysis of burnt areas spatial frequency and carbon exchanges of the regenerating forest stress the importance of considering large area disturbances for full carbon accounting. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

Satellite remote sensing using coarse resolution (≈1 km) sensors is thus well suited in documenting the spatial and temporal distribution of fires in this zone. The purpose of this study was to investigate the utility of the SPOT VEGETATION (VGT) sensor for estimating three key parameters related to boreal forest fire: burned area, postfire regeneration age, and aboveground biomass. Based on a sample of fires across Canada, the best overall discrimination of burned forest was provided by a normalized short-wave-based vegetation index (SWVI) that combines near-infrared (NIR) and short-wave infrared (SWIR) channels from VGT. Multitemporal differencing of this index from anniversary date VGT composites was combined synergistically with active fire locations from NOAA/AVHRR to map Canadian forest that burned during 1998 and 1999. National burned area estimates for both years were within 15% of those compiled by the Canadian Interagency Forest Fire Centre. The normalized index also was correlated (R=.68) with the age of regenerating forests in Saskatchewan and Manitoba that burned between 1949 and 1998. An artificial neural network (ANN) model developed using temporal metrics computed from VGT could predict the age of these forests with an RMS error of 7 years (R=.83). By contrast, forest biomass based on Canada's Forest Inventory (CanFI) was estimated with relatively poor accuracy (RMS=32 tons/ha) from VGT reflectance and terrestrial ecozone using a network model. We conclude that the VGT instrument is effective for mapping large boreal burns at the end of a fire season and approximating the age of regenerating burns less than about 30 years old.

However, estimation of carbon storage in moderate to high biomass forests is difficult for conventional optical and radar sensors. Lidar (light detection and ranging) instruments measure the vertical structure of forests and thus hold great promise for remotely sensing the quantity and spatial organization of forest biomass. In this study, we compare the relationships between lidar-measured canopy structure and coincident field measurements of above-ground biomass at sites in the temperate deciduous, temperate coniferous, and boreal coniferous biomes. A single regression for all three sites is compared with equations derived for each site individually. The single equation explains 84% of variance in above-ground biomass (P < 0.0001) and shows no statistically significant bias in its predictions for any individual site.","Above-ground biomass; Biomass measurement; Carbon storage; Forest biomass; Global carbon cycle; Interbiome comparison; Lidar remote sensing; SLICER sensor","aboveground biomass; biome; carbon; carbon cycle; lidar; biomass; carbon sequestration; forest; radar; remote sensing; stand structure",,,,,,,,,,,,"Lefsky, M.A.; Colorado State University, , Fort Collins, CO 80523-1470, United States; email: lefsky@cnr.colostate.edu",,,1466822X,,GEBIF,,"English","Global Ecol.

The model was calibrated and applied on two deciduous forest stands in Tuscany (Central Italy) by using conventional and remote sensing data as inputs. First, information on the two stands needed to initialise the model was derived from different sources, while meteorological data were extrapolated from a nearby station by an existing procedure (MT-Clim). Temporal profiles of leaf area index (LAI) were then derived both from direct ground measurement and from the processing of NOAA-AVHRR NDVI data. The model was calibrated using stand transpiration values obtained for 1997 by a sap flow method. Next, its performances were tested against the same transpiration values measured in 1998. The results obtained indicate that FOREST-BGC is capable of simulating water fluxes of Mediterranean forests when suitable LAI profiles are considered. Moreover, the derivation of these profiles from NDVI data can improve the model performance probably due to an enhanced consideration of the effects of the typical Mediterranean summer water stress. These results support the final objective of the work, which is the development of a procedure capable of integrating conventional and remote sensing data to operationally simulate water and carbon fluxes on a regional scale. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

The TRMM Science Data and Information System (TSDIS) fire algorithm routinely produces daily and monthly global fire products. These products have been achieved since January 1998. Any interested users may download these products from the TSDIS web page. The TSDIS night-time fire algorithm is a traditional threshold method using only the Visible and Infrared Scanner (VIRS) thermal band brightness temperatures. The daytime algorithm is a contextual approach that uses VIRS visible/near-infrared band reflectance and the University of Maryland (UMD) 1 km land type data to reject false fire pixels. This study compared the TSDIS fire products with the European Commission (EC) Joint Research Center (JRC) 1 km AVHRR fire products. The two products were in agreement on spatial and temporal variations over areas where both data were available. An analysis of the TSDIS monthly fire products during the two years of 1998 and 1999 manifested seasonal cycles of biomass fires over Southeast Asia, Africa, North America and South America. The data also showed interannual variations associated with the ENSO cycle in Central America and the Indonesian region during the two years. We compared the TSDIS monthly fire products with the aerosol index products of the Total Ozone Mapping Spectrometer (TOMS) of the NASA Earth Probe satellite. The results indicated that the major aerosol variations of the global atmosphere during the two years were associated with the smoke released by the biomass fires.",,"Aerosols; Algorithms; Biomass; Data reduction; Reflection; Spectrometers; Surface properties; Spatial variation; Rain; aerosol; algorithm; biomass burning; fire; remote sensing; smoke",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,01431161,,,,"English","Int.

In India the major sources of biomass burning include deforestation, shifting cultivation, accidental fires, controlled burning, fire wood burning, burning from agricultural residues and burning due to fire lines. Studies on biomass burning practices gain importance due to increasing anthropogenic activities and increasing rates of deforestation. Satellite data have been widely used over the globe to monitor the rates of deforestation and also with respect to biomass burning studies. But, much of the polar orbiting satellites, due to their repetitive cycle, have limitations in observing such events and in the tropics, due to cloud cover, getting a cloud-free image during the daytime is difficult. In this study we used Defence Meteorological Satellite Program Operational Line Scanner (DMSP-OLS) night-time data to study the biomass burning events over a period of 10 years from 1987 to 1998 for the Eastern Ghats region, covering the northern part of Andhra Pradesh, India. Two ground-based experiments were carried out to quantify the emissions from biomass burning practices. The results of the study with respect to trace gases suggested emission ratios for CO, CH4, NOx and N2O during the burning to be about 12.3%, 1.29%, 0.29% and 0.07% at the first site and 12.5%, 1.59%, 0.29% and 0.05% at the second site, suggesting low inter-fire variability between the sites. The variation has been attributed to the fuel load, vegetation characteristics, site conditions and local meteorological parameters affecting the relative amounts of combustion. Using the DMSP OLS derived areal estimates of active fires, the trace gas emissions released from the biomass burning were quantified. The results suggested the emissions of 8.2 × 1010 g CO2, 1.8 × 108 g CO, 6.0 × 106 g N2O, 3.0 × 106 g NOx and 1.2 × 108 g CH4 during March 1987. The emissions increased to 1.0 × 1011 g CO2, 2.3 × 108 g CO, 7.8 × 106 g N2O, 3.9 × 107 g NOx and 1.6 × 108 g CH4, over a period of 10 years. The results of the analysis suggest the possible use of monitoring biomass burning events from DMSP-OLS night-time data.",,"Biomass; Combustion; Forestry; Gas emissions; Meteorology; Satellites; Trace analysis; Trace gases; Remote sensing; biogenic emission; biomass burning; deciduous forest; dry forest; ground-based measurement; trace gas; Andhra Pradesh; India",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,01431161,,,,"English","Int.

The 30 + scenes of TM data are historic and lack detailed atmospheric data needed by physically-based atmospheric correction models such as 6S (Second Simulation of the Satellite Signal in the Solar Spectrum). Image based DOS models are based on image measurements and explored in this article for application to LBA study areas. Two methods using theoretical spectral radiance and image acquisition date respectively were used to convert TM DN values to at-satellite radiance. Three image-based models were employed using each method to convert at-satellite radiance to surface reflectance. Analyses of these six different image-based models were conducted. The Improved Image-based DOS was the best technique for correcting atmospheric effects in this LBA research with results similar to those obtained from physically-based approaches.",,"Data processing; Earth atmosphere; Image processing; Land use; Reforestation; Satellites; Atmospheric correction; Remote sensing; atmosphere-biosphere interaction; atmospheric correction; biomass; land cover; Landsat thematic mapper; remote sensing; Amazon River Basin; South America",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,01431161,,,,"English","Int.

This paper describes a system for monitoring carbon in New Zealand's forests and shrublands (6.3 and 2.6 million ha, respectively), which was tested on a 60 km-wide transect across the South Island. A 9 km2 grid was superimposed onto a land-cover map (SPOT imagery) to obtain 62 ground-sampling points. New permanent plots were established at 43 of these points and 18 existing plots were revisited (one site was inaccessible). On each plot, the dimensions of all trees, shrubs and coarse woody debris (CWD) were measured, and these measurements converted to per-hectare C-stocks using regression relationships. C-stocks in fine litter and mineral soil were quantified using data from New Zealand's national soil-C monitoring system that quantifies national-scale soil-C stocks using a soil-C database stratified by soil type, climate, and land-cover; we used these data to derive values for the transect. The total C-stock in all pools was 290 t/ha in forests and 163 t/ha in shrublands, 58 and 30% of which was living biomass (respectively). The living biomass components had the greatest variances, so precision could be improved by increasing the sample size of trees, particularly large trees. The C-stock of CWD was highly variable among plots, but was a relatively small component of the total C-stock (10% forest and 3% shrubland). For the moment, we know little about the uncertainty associated with measuring C-sequestration (i.e. change in C-stocks over time), but this information will become available when plots are resampled. Our network of permanent plots is designed deliberately to be simple and measurements of interest to conservation biologists, such as species composition and structure are included in the hope of protecting it against inevitable shifts in policy and focus. We discuss methodological issues including generalized allometric relationship, the propagation of errors, and better integration of remote-sensing and ground-based approaches, all of which have been considered in the development of this system. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

Methods Biomass and nitrogen concentration of green and nongreen portions of vegetation, moisture contents of three soil layers, and total and available soil nitrogen are included as state variables in the enhanced model. The model was parameterized and validated against field observations of biomass, productivity, plant and soil nitrogen concentration, nitrogen uptake, a vegetation index derived from satellite remote sensing and digital maps of vegetation and soil distributions along a forest transect in eastern China (FTEC). The model was applied to FTEC in order to investigate the responsive characteristics of the ecosystems to global climatic change. Scenarios of climate change under doubled CO2 produced by seven general circulation models (GCM) were used to drive the model. Results The simulations indicated that the model is capable of simulating accurately potential vegetation distribution and net primary productivity under contemporary climatic conditions. The simulations for GCM-projected future climate scenarios with doubled atmospheric CO2 concentration predicted that broadleaf forests would increase, but conifer forests, shrubs and grasses would decrease; and that deciduous forests would have the largest relative increase, but evergreen shrubs would have the largest decrease. Conclusions The overall effects of doubling CO2 and climatic changes on FTEC were to produce an increased net primary productivity (NPP) at equilibrium for all seven GCM scenarios. The inclusion of nitrogen dynamics in the model imposes more constraint on the responses of FTEC to climatic change than the previous version of the model without nitrogen dynamics. Temperature exerts a stronger control on NPP than precipitation, as indicated by the negative correlations between NPP and temperature. The southern portion of FTEC, at latitudes less than 33 °N, show much larger increases in annual NPP than in the north. However, the predicted range of NPP increases is much larger in the north than in the south.","Ecological transect; GCM; Global climatic change; Primary production; Terrestrial ecosystems; Vegetation model; Vegetation structure","biogeochemical cycle; ecosystem response; global change; nitrogen; primary production; vegetation dynamics; biomass; carbon dioxide; climate change; concentration (composition); general circulation model; model validation; soil nitrogen; transect; vegetation structure; China; Asia; China; Eurasia; Far East; Coniferophyta; Poaceae",,,,,,,,,,,,"Gao, Q.; Institute of Resources Science, , Beijing 100875, China; email: gaoq@bnu.edu.cn",,,1466822X,,GEBIF,,"English","Global Ecol.

Consequently, vegetation fires spread widely and were monitored by many satellites in real time. Satellite images are currently being used to monitor vegetation fires either globally for climate studies or more regionally for impact assessment. After reviewing different satellite data used for impact assessment, this paper focuses on the contribution of SPOT-4's imagery provided by high resolution HRVIR and coarse resolution VEGETATION sensors. These sensors are described with emphasis on those characteristics of potential benefit for forest mapping and fire detection. Early images of Roraima from SPOT-4 are analysed and interpreted to delineate the areas already damaged by fire. VEGETATION images provide a first estimate of damaged areas on a regional scale and an indication of the main ecosystems affected. SPOT HRVIR is used to establish a much more precise classification of various ecosystems. Each vegetation class is associated with a biomass density. From the known burned areas, an estimate of burned biomass during the 1998 dry season is computed, as well as total carbon release. On an intensive study site of 20 400 km2, 3060 km2 of savannahs and crops and 6980 km2 of forest have been burned; the corresponding carbon release is estimated as 210000 t for croplands and savannahs and 23 M t for the evergreen seasonal forest. The estimated burnt surface areas derived from VEGETATION are then cross-validated with HRVIR and thus an attempt is made to extrapolate the burned biomass with the help of VEGETATION on a regional scale.",,"Biomass; Data acquisition; Ecosystems; Forestry; Satellites; Tropics; Vegetation; Vegetation sensors; Remote sensing; forest fire; hazard assessment; monitoring system; satellite imagery; SPOT; vegetation mapping; Brazil; Roraima State",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,01431161,,,,"English","Int.

A simulation model, the Boreal Ecosystem Productivity Simulator (BEPS), has been developed. The model uses a sunlit and shaded leaf separation strategy and a daily integration scheme in order to implement an instantaneous leaf-level photosynthesis model over large areas. Two key driving variables, leaf area index (every 10 days) and land cover type (annual), are derived from satellite measurements of the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR). Other spatially explicit input data are also prepared, including daily meteorological data (radiation, precipitation, temperature, and humidity), available soil water holding capacity (AWC) and forest biomass. The model outputs are compared with ground plot data to ensure that no significant systematic biases are created. The simulation results show that Canada's annual net primary production was 1.22 Gt C year-1 in 1994, 78% attributed to forests, mainly the boreal forest, without considering the contribution of the understorey. The NPP averaged over the entire landmass was ∼140 g C m-2 year-1 in 1994. Geographically, NPP varied greatly among ecozones and provinces/territories. The seasonality of NPP is characterized by strong summer photosynthesis capacities and a short growing season in northern ecosystems. This study is the first attempt to simulate Canada-wide NPP with a process-based model at 1-km resolution and using a daily step. The statistics of NPP are therefore expected to be more accurate than previous analyses at coarser spatial or temporal resolutions. The use of remote sensing data makes such simulations possible. BEPS is capable of integrating the effects of climate, vegetation, and soil on plant growth at a regional scale. BEPS and its parameterization scheme and products can be a basis for future studies of the carbon cycle in mid-high latitude ecosystems.","Biogeochemical processes; Boreal forest; Canada; Ecological modelling; Net primary productivity; Remote sensing; Terrestrial carbon","biogeochemical cycle; boreal forest; ecological modeling; net primary production; remote sensing; ecosystem modeling; growth response; land cover; leaf area index; photosynthesis; Canada; North America",,,,,,,,,,,,"Chen, J.M.; Department of Geography, 100 St George Street, Toronto, Ontario M5S 3G3, Canada; email: chenj@geog.utoronto.ca",,,1466822X,,GEBIF,,"English","Global Ecol.

Global Positioning System (GPS) information encoded on the video audio track was extracted by mosaicking software that automatically generates geocoded digital mosaics from video clips. On the 1999 survey, a laser altimeter recorded profiles of terrain and vegetation canopy heights. A validation dataset was compiled from the videography for a portion of the GRFM mosaics extending 6° by 4° in longitude and latitude, using randomly selected points along flight lines. Other applications of the VOAM videography include acquisition of ground control points for image geolocation, creation of a high-resolution geocoded mosaic of a forest study area, forest biomass estimation, and rapid assessment of fire damage.

The following land cover types were investigated: bare soil, agriculture, pastures, forest regrowth from 1 to 23-years-old and primary forest. Backscatter behavior of regrowth stands is influenced by the previous land use and by human impacts such as fire and selective logging. This selective logging can be mechanized or not, because people who live in the Amazon usually cut trees to build houses, bridges, fences, etc. Backscatter of young regrowth stands on sites immediately abandoned after slash and burn increases at a faster rate than young regrowth on sites abandoned after some years of agriculture. Backscatter of old regrowth stands also behaves differently where there are disturbances such as fire or selective logging.

The classifier was implemented using the Japanese Earth Remote Sensing Satellite (JERS-1) 100 m resolution radar data acquired over the Amazon Rainforest as part of the Global Rainforest Mapping (GRFM) Project. Demonstrated here is the use of the information content present in different texture measurements at different scales to separate three categories of land cover types: forest from nonforest, terre firme from floodplain vegetation, and grassland from woodland savanna. Various combinations of first-order image statistics known as texture measures were used at different scales as feature dimensions to aid the class discrimination. Eight of the most common first-order texture measures found in the literature were used. The best combination of texture measures at each scale were determined by employing a class separability test using the Bhattachuryya distance. The results were then used as input images into a supervised multiscale maximum likelihood estimation classifier. The classified maps were validated against independent test sites, and by comparison with a Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) classification. It was found that JERS-1 backscatter and texture measures can discriminate forest from nonforest types with very high accuracy (above 90%). Old secondary forest or regrowth areas were often mixed with forest. Radar backscatter alone was able to separate terre firme and floodplain vegetation. However, texture measures were important in separating open from dense floodplain vegetation. Similarly, the backscatter sensitivity to low biomass values was instrumental in separating woodland from grassland savanna. Texture had a lesser role in separating these two vegetation types but was important to separate the woodland savanna from dense evergreen forest and secondary forests.",,"Backscattering; Forestry; Image analysis; Mapping; Maximum likelihood estimation; Remote sensing; Textures; Thematic mapper; Tropical engineering; classification; floodplain; JERS-1; land cover; monitoring; rainforest; vegetation mapping; Amazonia; Brazil; Rondonia State",,,,,,,,,,,,"Podest, E.; Jet Propulsion Laboratory, 4800 Oak Grove Drive, Pasadena, CA 91109, United States; email: erika.podest@jpl.nasa.gov",,"Taylor and Francis Ltd.",01431161,,IJSED,,"English","Int.

While existing remote sensing applications are providing estimates of the rates of deforestation and the fate of the cleared land (pasture, croplands, or secondary vegetation), techniques for estimating biomass of natural systems with remote sensing are needed. Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) presents a unique opportunity for imaging tropical forests under most cloud conditions and potentially provides information on vegetation biomass. Models for estimating above-ground biomass from SAR data have been developed. In this paper we examine the temporal and spatial variability of mean normalized radar cross-section across a chrono-sequence of secondary vegetation stands and clearings in Rondonia, Brazil. We also assess the impact of the observed temporal and spatial variability in normalized radar cross-section on estimating biomass of secondary vegetation stands. Results indicate that, while quantitative estimates of biomass are not stable due to intrinsic texture, system noise, and environmental effects, JERS-1 data are still useful for categorizing relative differences in development of secondary vegetation stands.

Such assessments are important, for example, in connection with the establishment of heating plants for local communities. A sparse grid of field sample plots from an existing national forest inventory (NFI) is used as reference data for satellite image based estimates of forest condition. The data thus obtained will be in a format that makes them readily available for existing forestry scenario models, in this case the Swedish Hugin system. Thus, forecasts of future harvesting levels and the corresponding amounts of forest fuels - mainly from branches and tops - can be derived in a straightforward manner. The proposed method was evaluated in two test areas in northern Sweden, the communes of Vindeln and Älvsbyn. Besides a base-line scenario for the forecasts, a scenario with geographical restrictions as to the extraction of forest fuels was tested. With a maximum transportation distance of 300 m to road, the available forest fuel potential was shown to decrease by more than 50%. With the proposed method, this kind of geographical restriction is easily implemented. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Texture analysis is carried out for normalized difference images calculated from visible and thermal infrared images of the Indonesian forest fire in 1997. Smoke regions are identified by assuming threshold values for the resulting texture feature as well as for radiances in the original and difference images. It is found that when the thresholds are chosen appropriately for GMS visible and infrared spin scan radiometer, 94% pixels exhibit agreement between the classification results using the texture analysis and the supervised Euclidean classification. Agreement is found for 96% pixels in mutual verification using the VISSR image and a concurrent NOAA advanced very high resolution radiometer image. A correlation coefficient of 0.91 is obtained between the results from the two sensors in the variation of the number of smoke pixels accumulated for 12 days in September 1997. Additionally, it is confirmed that as the threshold value of the texture feature is increased, the variation range of the aerosol optical thickness is also increased. As a whole, this study indicates that texture analysis provides quite reasonable results in the smoke detection when appropriately combined with the spectral information. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Spatiotemporal differences in a satellite-derived vegetation index (VI) are examined with respect to antecedent moisture conditions, temporal variations in ozone exposure levels, and measured foliar injury values from 1985. Seasonal ozone exposure levels (SUM60 and W126) increased from 1982 to 1998 and were significantly correlated (r = 0.49 and 0.53, α = 0.05) with annual population totals in the Tucson area. Extensive masking of satellite images from 1972, 1986, and 1992 resulted in two optimal change detection areas, with one site, TVWMica, exposed mostly to the Tucson air pollution plume, while the other site, EMica, was more protected from Tucson-derived pollution. An overall increase in VI from 1972 to 1992 at both sites appears to have been caused by an increase in moisture availability. Larger foliar injury values in 1985 were associated with a smaller increase in VI (i.e., a smaller increase in green leaf biomass) from 1972 to 1986. From 1972 to 1986 and from 1986 to 1992, VI values at TV/WMica increased at a slower rate compared to those at EMica, The reduced increase in ""green-up"" may have been caused partially by ozone-induced foliar injury and resulting decreases in green leaf biomass. However, these spatial differences in VI values may have also been caused by a number of other factors. Results nevertheless reveal the strong possibility of distinct, topographically based, spatial variations in ozone-induced foliar injury within the Rincons.","Foliar injury; Landsat MSS; Ozone; Ponderosa pine; Southwestern United States; Vegetation index","Biomass; Ozone; Thermal plumes; Vegetation; Weather satellites; Vegetation index (VI); Forestry; ozone; ozone; water; ecosystem health; forest canopy; injury; Landsat multispectral scanner; ozone; remote sensing; vegetation index; air pollution; article; biomass; forest management; landscape; leaf litter; moisture; pine; plant leaf; population; scientific literature; telecommunication; topography; United States; vegetation; air pollutant; environmental exposure; environmental monitoring; geography; photochemical smog; pine; season; tree; United States; Air Pollutants; Arizona; Biomass; Environmental Exposure; Environmental Monitoring; Geography; Oxidants, Photochemical; Ozone; Pinus; Plant Leaves; Seasons; Trees; Water",,,,,,,,,,,,"Diem, J.E.; Department of Anthropology, 33 Gilmer Street, Atlanta, GA 30303-3083, United States",,,0364152X,,EMNGD,"11830767","English","Environ.

The characterization of vegetation structure can be a laborious task and so managers and researchers are seeking alternatives through the use of remote sensing. Forest structure and the distribution of biomass through the forest canopy has a significant effect on radar backscatter and, in many cases, is the overwhelming variable in determining the type and quantity of radar backscatter observed in forest environments. In southern Tasmania a combination of field-based inventory plots and forest type maps were accessed to condense large variations in forest structure into five archetypical structural forest types. We then utilized a forest backscatter model to simulate the backscatter response of these five forest structural types for a range of radar wavelengths and polarizations. Good correlative relationships were obtained between backscatter and forest structure. There was a particularly good relationship between synthetic aperture radar to variations in allocation of biomass to stems, branches, and leaves. These individual and grouped attributes in eucalypt forests appear to influence radar backscatter enough to develop predictive relationships between backscatter and forest structure. Strong correlations were observed with radar P- and C-band wavelengths with foliage and bole biomass and between the ratio of L to C with foliage and branch allocations. Within Australian wet sclerophyll forests, where the biomass is typically very high, the true capacity and applicability of radar imagery may not be in direct biomass estimation but rather in the capacity of radar data to stratify forest stands based on structural variation.","Australia; Eucalypt; Forest type; Radar","Backscattering; Biomass; Managers; Remote sensing; Synthetic aperture radar; Vegetation; Forest structure; Forestry",,"Acknowledgements This work is a component of a project involving CSIRO Forestry and Forest Products (CSIRO FFP), Forestry Tasmania (FT) and the Australian Greenhouse Office (AGO).

The fire regime at any given location in these regions is a result of complex interactions between forest biomass, topography, ignitions, and weather. Forest structure and biomass are important aspects in determining current and future fire regimes. Efforts to quantify live and dead forest biomass at the local to regional scale has been hindered by the uncertainty surrounding the measurement and modeling of forest ecosystem processes and fluxes. The interaction of elevated CO2 with climate, soil nutrients, and other forest management factors that affect forest growth and fuel loading will play a major role in determining future forest stand growth and the distribution of species across the southern United States. The use of satellite image analysis has been tested for timely and accurate measurement of spatially explicit land use change and is well suited for use in inventory and monitoring of forest carbon. The incorporation of Landsat Thematic Mapper data coupled with a physiologically based productivity model (PnET), soil water holding capacity, and historic and projected climatic data provides an opportunity to enhance field plot based forest inventory and monitoring methodologies. We use periodic forest inventory data from the USDA Forest Service's Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) project to obtain estimates of forest area and type to generate estimates of carbon storage for evergreen, deciduous, and mixed forest classes for use in an assessment of remotely sensed forest cover at the regional scale for the southern United States. The displays of net primary productivity (NPP) generated from the PnET model show areas of high and low forest carbon storage potential and their spatial relationship to other landscape features for the southern United States. At the regional scale, predicted annual NPP in 1992 ranged from 836 to 2181 g/m2/year for evergreen forests and 769-2634 g/m2/year for deciduous forests with a regional mean for all forest land of 1448 g/m2/year. Prediction of annual NPP in 2050 ranged from 913 to 2076 g/m2/year for evergreen forest types to 1214-2376 g/m2/year for deciduous forest types with a regional mean for all forest land of 1659 g/m2/year. The changes in forest productivity from 1992 to 2050 are shown to display potential areas of increased or decreased forest biomass.

Additionally, estimation of forest structural attributes, such as aboveground biomass (AGBM), is an important step in identifying the amount of carbon in terrestrial vegetation pools and is central to global carbon cycle studies. Although current remote sensing techniques recover such tropical forest structure poorly, new large-footprint lidar instruments show great promise. As part of a prelaunch validation plan for the Vegetation Canopy Lidar (VCL) mission, the Laser Vegetation Imaging Sensor (LVIS), a large-footprint airborne scanning lidar, was flown over the La Selva Biological Station, a tropical wet forest site in Costa Rica. The primary objective of this study was to test the ability of large-footprint lidar instruments to recover forest structural characteristics across a spectrum of land cover types from pasture to secondary and primary tropical forests. LVIS metrics were able to predict field-derived quadratic mean stem diameter (QMSD), basal area, and AGBM with R2 values of up to .93, .72, and .93, respectively. These relationships were significant and nonasymptotic through the entire range of conditions sampled at the La Selva. Out results confirm the ability of large-footprint lidar instruments to estimate important structural attributes, including biomass in dense tropical forests, and when taken along with similar results from studies in temperate forests, strongly validate the VCL mission framework. © 2002 Elsevier Science Inc.

This study focuses on large unmanaged pine plantations in a vast flat area of ca. 500,000 ha where the tree biomass ranges from 0 to 200 m3/ha corresponding to different forest canopy structures. Results show a good correlation between the backscattering coefficient σ0 (with a 6-dB dynamic range and R2 ≥ .8), the stand timber volume and the stand density. The trend is mainly driven by stand density and different relationships are observed according to age class, which explicitly points out the effects of canopy structure on the backscattering level. Stem volume is derived from the inversion of statistical and semiempirical models, which take these effects into account. Inversion results show that forest biomass attributes can be estimated with relatively small errors commensurate with those achieved by field measurements. Best overall accuracy of ca. 21 m3/ha is reached with the semiempirical model. Error decomposition as a function of age classes shows that, for the same biomass range, errors are higher for old stands than for young stands. Finally, the results indicate that (1) JERS-1 data can be used in an operational way for estimating the biomass of such plantations and (2) it is necessary to take forest stand structure into account. In order to develop reliable biomass-retrieval schemes, future research should focus on examining in a more mechanistic way the relationship between canopy structure and radar signature. © 2002 Elsevier Science Inc.

Typical values of the optical properties for smoke aerosols derived from such field experiments as Smoke, Clouds, and Radiation-Brazil (SCAR-B); Transport and Atmospheric Chemistry near the Equator-Atlantic (TRACE-A); Biomass Burning Airborne and Spaceborne Experiment in the Amazonas (BASE-A); and Boreal Ecosystem-Atmosphere Study (BOREAS) were first assumed for retrieving smoke optical depths. It is found that the maximum top-of-atmosphere (TOA) reflectance values calculated by models with these aerosol parameters are less than observations whose values are considerably higher. A successful retrieval would require an aerosol model that either has a substantially smaller asymmetry parameter (g < 0.4 versus g > 0.5;, or higher single-scattering albedo (ω ≫ 0.9 versus ω < 0.9), or both (e.g., g = 0.39 and ω = 0.91 versus g = 0.57 and ω = 0.87) than the existing models. Several potential causes were examined including small smoke particle size, low black carbon content, humidity effect, calibration errors, inaccurate surface albedo, mixture of cloud and aerosol layers, etc. A more sound smoke aerosol model is proposed that has a lower content of black carbon (mass ratio = 0.015) and smaller size (mean radius = 0.02 μm for dry smoke particles), together with consideration of the effect of relative humidity. Ground-based observations of smoke suggest that for τ < 2.5 there is an increasing trend in ω and a decreasing trend in g with increases in τ, which is consistent with the results of satellite retrievals. Using these relationships as constraints, more plausible values of τ can be obtained for heavy smoke aerosol. The possibility of smoke-cloud mixtures is also considered, which can also lead to high TOA reflectances. However, without measurements, the hypothesis can be neither accepted nor negated. The study demonstrates that without independent assessments of the optical properties, large uncertainties would be incurred in the retrieved values of optical depth for heavy smoke aerosol plumes.",,"Aerosols; Atmospheric chemistry; Fires; Optical properties; Radiometers; Smoke; Thermal plumes; Forest fires; Earth atmosphere; aerosol; atmospheric plume; forest fire; optical depth; remote sensing; smoke; uncertainty analysis",,,,,,,,,,,,"Li, Z.; Department of Meteorology, 2335 Computes/Space Sci.

Over the north and south islands of New Zealand we couple a simple vegetation process based model 3PG (Predicting Physiological Principals of Growth) with constraints provided by estimates of the fraction of photo-synthetically absorbed radiation (fPAR) derived from the SPOT 4 satellite. Model predictions of national forest and scrub above ground Net Primary productivity (NPPA) were compared to estimated values derived from previously published values at both individual plot locations and regions, stratified by vegetation type. Comparison of the field estimated fraction of fPAR values across the range of vegetation types in the North and South Islands and SPOT 4 VEGETATION NDVI indices indicated the imagery explained 83% of the variation in fPAR. The 3-PG predictions coupled with remote sensing observations of above ground stand NPPA for 6 individual sites across both islands correlated well (adjusted r2=0.80, p &lt; 0.001) with field estimates however the relationship had a significant offset with the model over predicting stem NPPA of individual plots. A comparison of regional estimates of stem NPPA also correlated well (adjusted r2=0.74, p &lt; 0.001) again with model prediction, having a significant offset. A key discussion point is the accuracy of model verification, as scalable plot and regional estimates of forest and scrub NPPA with which to verify the model are difficult to obtain and often unsuited for comparison. Despite this, the correspondence between values of predicted NPPA by the coupled model and those estimated from conventional forestry measurement techniques indicates that the model provides a sound and useful framework for regional modeling of forest growth. The results also highlight that, from the model output, it is possible to identify the constraints imposed on growth by vapor pressure deficit, soil water balance and temperature. © 2002 Taylor &amp; Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,10106049,,,,"English","Geocarto Int.",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85010491129

The authors are engaged in the project 'Human Dimensions of Amazonia: Forest Regeneration and Landscape Structure' in NASA/INPE's Large Scale Biosphere-Atmosphere Experiment in Amazonia (LBA) programme. This project requires use of corrected Landsat TM data since research foci integrate ground-based data and TM to: (1) measure and model biomass; (2) classify multiple stages of secondary succession; (3) model land cover/land use changes; and (4) derive spectral signatures consistent across different study areas. The 30+ scenes of TM data are historic and lack detailed atmospheric data needed by physically-based atmospheric correction models such as 6S (Second Simulation of the Satellite Signal in the Solar Spectrum). Imagebased DOS models are based on image measurements and explored in this article for application to LBA study areas. Two methods using theoretical spectral radiance and image acquisition date respectively were used to convert TM DN values to at-satellite radiance. Three image-based models were employed using each method to convert at-satellite radiance to surface reflectance. Analyses of these six different image-based models were conducted. The Improved Imagebased DOS was the best technique for correcting atmospheric effects in this LBA research with results similar to those obtained from physically-based approaches. © 2002 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Lu, D.; Department of Geography, , Terre Haute, IN, 47809, United States",,,01431161,,,,"English","Int.

Quantitative physical models were used to estimate forest LAD from radar and hyperspectral airborne remote sensing observations. A parameter-estimation technique based on physical models minimizes the need for in situ observations and thereby facilitates global remote sensing of forest structure. Using data from the NASA Airborne Synthetic Aperture Radar (AIRSAR) and the NASA Airborne Visible and Infrared Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS) over three forest plots in Central Oregon, parameters were estimated separately from the radar and hyperspectral data and then combined to form LAD. Gaussian relative LAD profiles were estimated from multialtitude interferometric and polarimetric AIRSAR data. Leaf area indices (LAI) were estimated from AVIRIS data and used to normalize the relative density profiles to produce LAD as a function of height. LAD was also determined from field measurements of geometric tree properties and LAI. LADs in the three forest plots were in the 0.02-0.18 m2 m-3 range, with LAIs in the range 0.8-2.4 m2 m-2. The agreement between the remotely sensed and field-measured LAD was typically 0.02 m2m-3 but occasionally as high as 0.06 m2m-3, which was within a 1 -2 standard error range. More complex models for the remotely sensed relative density, along with more diverse radar observation strategies, will improve LAD accuracy in the future. LAD estimation will also improve when radar, hyperspectral, and other relevant remote sensing data sets are combined in a single parameter-estimation process, as opposed to the separate estimations performed in this first LAD demonstration.

In India, major sources of biomass burning is from deforestation, shifting cultivation, accidental fires, controlled burning, fire wood burning, burning from agricultural residues, burning due to fire lines, etc. Present study attempts to quantify the GHG emissions from slash and burn agriculture practices over Secondary mixed deciduous forests from Eastern Ghats of India. IRS-P4 OCM satellite data pertaining to study area has been used to study location, areal extent and intensity of fires. Three ground based experiments have been conducted to quantify CO, CO2, O3 and other trace gases using online analyzers and grab sampling. Fuel characteristics have been analyzed prior to burning and combustion factors for the sites have been calculated using the pre and post-fire biomass values. Analysis of the results with respect to fuel loads suggested that nearly 80% of the stems occurred in the girth class between 10-40 girth, indicating very poor and secondary nature of the forest. The fire intensity is found to be in the range of 31086 Kjs−1m−1 to 60847 Kjs−1m−1. The individual combustion completeness suggested that among the different components of biomass, branch material with less than 10 cm and upto 5 cm dbh contributed more than 60% of combustion. Mixed leaf litter contributed to more than about 50% of individual combustion completeness at all sites, with third site having the highest (84%). The contribution of dry biomass material that are having more than 70 cm diameter is found very low. With respect to trace gas emissions, emission ratios have been determined with reference to CO2. Using the GIS, by integrating satellite derived areal estimates from IRS-P4 OCM data and ground based studies, trace gas emissions released from biomass burning suggested emissions of 3.0 × 105 gms of CO2, 9.0 × 103 gms of CO, 3.0 × 102 gms of N2O, 1.5 × 103 gms of NOx and 6.4 × 103 gms of CH4 for the study area. © 2002 Taylor &amp; Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,10106049,,,,"English","Geocarto Int.",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33751508382

We compare the measured optical parameters with calculations from the size distributions, which assume the aerosol to consist of sulfuric acid near the tropopause and mixtures of ammonium sulfate and soot in the remaining column. We obtain closure to within 25% for the optical depth of a column, which includes a biomass-burning aerosol of North American origin, and infer a soot volume fraction of 35% for this aerosol. Assuming spheroidal particles of prolate shape and the average aspect ratio of the particles to be 1.3 in the biomass-burning aerosol layer, the calculated depolarization agrees with the lidar measurement, whereas comparing the spectral backscatter coefficient shows the soot to be externally mixed with the nonabsorbing particles. With the two-stream approximation, we estimate the local, instantaneous, cloud-free radiative forcing of the biomass-burning aerosol at the tropopause to -5.8 W/m2 with a corresponding optical depth of 0.09 at 710 nm wavelength and solar zenith angle of 56°. The radiative forcing for the biomass-burning aerosol is as sensitive to a change in state of mixture, either external or internal, as to a change in surface albedo, ocean to coniferous forest.

Although foliar N is used by ecosystem models to predict rates of leaf-level photosynthesis, it has rarely been examined as a direct scalar to stand-level carbon gain. Establishment of such relationships would greatly simplify the nature of forest C and N linkages, enhancing our ability to derive estimates of forest productivity at landscape to regional scales. Here, we report on a highly predictive relationship between whole-canopy nitrogen concentration and aboveground forest productivity in diverse forested stands of varying age and species composition across the 360 000-ha White Mountain National Forest, New Hampshire, USA. We also demonstrate that hyperspectral remote sensing can be used to estimate foliar N concentration, and hence forest production across a large number of contiguous images. Together these data suggest that canopy-level N concentration is an important correlate of productivity in these forested systems, and that imaging spectrometry of canopy N can provide direct estimates of forest productivity across large landscapes.","Foliar chemistry; Forest C and N linkages; Forest canopy-level N concentration; Forest productivity; Nitrogen; Remote sensing, hyperspectral, AVIRIS; White Mountain National Forest, New Hampshire, USA","aboveground production; canopy; forest ecosystem; measurement method; nitrogen; remote sensing; New Hampshire; United States; White Mountain National Forest",,,,,,,,,,,,"Smith, M.-L.; USDA Forest Service, , Durham, NH 03824, United States; email: marielouisesmith@fs.fed.us",,"Ecological Society of America",10510761,,ECAPE,,"English","Ecol.

Scarce information on canopy dimensions reflects the difficulties associated with measuring crown height, width, depth, and area in tall, humid tropical forests. New field and spaceborne observations provide an opportunity to acquire these measurements, but the accuracy and reliability of the methods are unknown. We used a handheld laser range finder to estimate tree crown height, diameter, and depth in a lowland tropical forest in the eastern Amazon, Brazil, for a sampling of 300 trees stratified by diameter at breast height (DBH). We found significant relationships between DBH and both tree height and crown diameter derived from the laser measurements. We also quantified changes in crown shape between tree height classes, finding a significant but weak positive trend between crown depth and width. We then compared the field-based measurements of crown diameter and area to estimates derived manually from panchromatic 0.8 m spatial resolution IKONOS satellite imagery. Median crown diameter derived from satellite observations was 78 percent greater than that derived from field-based laser measurements. The statistical distribution of crown diameters from IKONOS was biased toward larger trees, probably due to merging of smaller tree crowns, underestimation of understory trees, and overestimation of individual crown dimensions. The median crown area derived from IKONOS was 65 percent higher than the value modeled from field-based measurements. We conclude that manual interpretation of IKONOS satellite data did not accurately estimate distributions of tree crown dimensions in a tall tropical forest of eastern Amazonia. Other methods will be needed to more accurately estimate crown dimensions from high spatial resolution satellite imagery.","Allometry; Amazon; Biomass; Brazil; Canopy dimensions; Forest canopy; IKONOS laser; LIDAR","canopy architecture; laser method; satellite imagery; stand structure; tropical forest; Amazonia; Brazil",,,,,,,,,,,,"Asner, G.P.; Department of Global Ecology, , Stanford, CA 94305, United States; email: gasher@globalecology.stanford.edu",,"Association for Tropical Biology Inc.",00063606,,BTROA,,"English","Biotropica",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0036962896

In the present study an attempt has been made to quantify the carbon fluxes through mathematical modeling of land use / land cover changes (LU/LC) Digital change image from satellite data, over two time periods has been used as an input in studying LU/LC changes and thereby carbon dynamics. Information pertaining to LU/LC has been mathematically modeled through land use transition matrix, with leading diagonal elements representing the land use of retained category of carbon accumulation and off-diagonal elements representing the changes in land use over a period of time. Total carbon flux has been modeled by taking areal estimates of LU/LC changes of two time periods and carbon factors for soil and standing biomass. Trace gases from shifting cultivation areas have been quantified based on ratio's of non carbondioxide trace gases to total carbon released by burning. Results of the study, through land use transition matrix suggests that over a period of eight years, 16.1% of dense forest and 10.02% of scrub forests were converted into agricultural lands. In the conversion process, there has been a loss of 47.97 Mt of Carbon from the forested lands. Dry matter burnt through shifting cultivation has been found to be 16.81 Mt. Green house gas emissions calculated from total carbon released associated with shifting cultivation suggests that CO 2 , CH 4 , CO, NO and NO x emissions accounted for about 8.405 Mt, 0.315 Mt, 1.77 Mt, 9.24 × 10 -4 Mt and 3.34 × 10 -3 Mt's respectively from the study area. © 2002 COSPAR.

In last couple of years satellite remote sensing has been successfully used for biomass and productivity estimation. The unique characteristic of plants is displayed by its reflectance in red and infrared region of electro-magnetic radiation. These have relationship with the biophysical parameters of plants. Therefore, process based models were developed to make use of the remotely sensed data available on monthly basis for estimation of Net Primary Productivity (NPP).

Although aboveground biomass is difficult to quantify over large areas using traditional techniques, lidar remote sensing holds great promise for biomass estimation because it directly measures components of canopy structure such as canopy height and the vertical distribution of intercepted canopy surfaces. In this study, our primary goal was to explore the sensitivity of lidar to differences in canopy structure and aboveground biomass in a dense, neotropical rainforest. We first examined the relationship between simple vertical canopy profiles derived from field measurements and the estimated aboveground biomass (EAGB) across a range of field plots located in primary and secondary tropical rainforest and in agroforesty areas. We found that metrics from field-derived vertical canopy profiles are highly correlated (R2 up to. 94) with EAGB across the entire range of conditions sampled. Next, we found that vertical canopy profiles from a large-footprint lidar instrument were closely related with coincident field profiles, and that metrics from both field and lidar profiles are highly correlated. As a result, metrics from lidar profiles are also highly correlated (R2 up to. 94) with EAGB across this neotropical landscape. These results help to explain the nature of the relationship between lidar data and EAGB, and also lay the foundation to explore the generality of the relationship between vertical canopy profiles and biomass in other tropical regions. © 2002 Elsevier Science Inc.

This occurs because forest remnants have dry, fire-prone edges, are juxtaposed with frequently burned pastures, and are often degraded by selective logging, which increases forest desiccation and fuel loading. Here we demonstrate that in eastern Amazonia, fires are operating as a large-scale edge effect in the sense that most fires originate outside fragments and penetrate considerable distances into forest interiors. Multi-temporal analyses of satellite imagery from two frontier areas reveal that fire frequency over 12-14-y periods was substantially elevated within at least 2400 m of forest margins. Application of these data with a mathematical core-area model suggests that even large forest remnants (up to several hundred thousand ha in area) could be vulnerable to edge-related fires. The synergistic interactions of forest fragmentation, logging and human-ignited fires pose critical threats to Amazonian forests, particularly in more seasonal areas of the basin.","Amazon; Brazil; Carbon emissions; Conservation; Deforestation drought; Fire; Habitat fragmentation; Logging; Rain forest; Remote sensing; Tropical forest","edge effect; fire; habitat fragmentation; remote sensing; tropical forest; Amazonia; South America",,,,,,,,,,,,"Laurance, W.F.; Smithsonian Tropical Res.

The study, which was conducted in a region at the savannah/forest transition in the southwestern part of the Central African Republic, explores the differential impact on land cover of early- and late-season fires and analyses burning regimes as a function of human use of the land. This was addressed using multivariate regression models between maps of land-cover change derived from remote sensing data, maps of burnt areas and a detailed map of ecotypes. In dense forests, burning is strongly associated with land-cover changes, while in savannahs the occurrence of (mostly) early fires does not lead to land-cover change. Fires associated with continuous and fragmented burnt patches have similar impacts on vegetation cover. Dense semi-humid forests in the study area were affected by a high level of burning due to land uses at their peripheries. The results confirm recent findings concerning human control on the timing of burning in savannahs. Early fires fragment the landscape and prevent the spatial diffusion of later damaging fires. Where no human settlements are present, late fires become more prevalent. Finally, the study measured an increase in vegetation cover in a few areas affected by very early burning. Using burnt area rather than active fire data allowed a better analysis of the spatial association between landscape attributes and burning events. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

M5S 3G3, Canada","Accurate and fast non-destructive measurements of leaf area index (LAI) of plant canopies are essential to environmental applications such as water and carbon cycle modelling. A commonly used technique to acquire LAI in situ is based on measurements of radiation transmittance through the canopy with optical instruments. The LAI-2000, that obtains measurements of effective LAI (Le: LAI retrieved assuming random foliage distribution) based on gap fraction at five view angles, is designed to work under diffuse light conditions. The LAI-2000 makes use of blue light to minimise the effect of light scattering in the canopy on LAI measurements. However, actual field LAI measurements are still routinely done under a range of illumination conditions, including direct sunlight. The LAI values measured under conditions of either partial or full direct light are generally smaller than the ones obtained under diffuse conditions. Although this error source is prevailing in many field LAI measurements, hitherto the problem has not been tackled rigorously. To better understand and improve the LAI-2000 measurements taken under non-ideal conditions, measurements were taken in two deciduous and two coniferous forest sites at different times of cloudless days to study how the scattering of the blue light by plant canopies affects LAI measurements. The sites are located in Larose forest near Ottawa, Canada. It is shown through these measurements and modelling with the canopy radiative transfer model Five-scale [Remote Sens. Rev. 19 (2000) 293-305] that the blue light scattering causes underestimation of effective LAI by up to 20% when measured under direct sunlight. A correction for the scattering effect, as a function of solar zenith angle and the effective LAI measured under the sunlit condition, is found through an empirical fit to the measured data in a limited range as well as model-simulated data in the full possible range possible. It is also found that the LAI-2000 fourth ring (47-58° from zenith) gives a more consistent correction than the other rings and that this ring used alone is also suitable for effective LAI retrieval under diffuse conditions. The correction scheme can reduce the error in effective LAI measurements to within 2%. It is therefore suggested that in field programs with logistic constraints, the LAI-2000 time of operation during sunny days can be extended beyond the diffuse illumination conditions near sunrise and sunset since the influence of the direct sunlight on the LAI measurements can be mostly removed using the correction scheme provided in this study. © 2001 Published by Elsevier Science B.V.","Larose forest; Leaf area index; Multiple scattering effect; Plant canopies","canopy; correction; leaf area index; light scattering; remote sensing",,,,,,,,,,,,"Leblanc, S.G.; Canada Centre for Remote Sensing, 588 Booth Street, Ottawa, Ont.

Some of the missing carbon is sequestered in vegetation biomass and, under the Kyoto Protocol of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, industrialized nations can use certain forest biomass sinks to meet their greenhouse gas emissions reduction commitments. Therefore, we analyzed 19 years of data from remote-sensing spacecraft and forest inventories to identify the size and location of such sinks. The results, which cover the years 1981-1999, reveal a picture of biomass carbon gains in Eurasian boreal and North American temperate forests and losses in some Canadian boreal forests. For the 1.42 billion hectares of Northern forests, roughly above the 30th parallel, we estimate the biomass sink to be 0.68 ± 0.34 billion tons carbon per year, of which nearly 70% is in Eurasia, in proportion to its forest area and in disproportion to its biomass carbon pool. The relatively high spatial resolution of these estimates permits direct validation with ground data and contributes to a monitoring program of forest biomass sinks under the Kyoto protocol.",,"carbon; fossil fuel; article; biomass; exhaust gas; forest; global climate; industrialization; North America; priority journal; remote sensing; United Nations; Biomass; Carbon; Trees; Wood",,,,,,,,,,,,"Myneni, R.B.; Department of Geography, 675 Commonwealth Avenue, Boston, MA 02215, United States; email: rmyneni@bu.edu",,,00278424,,PNASA,"11742094","English","Proc.

The Land Use Change and Climate Change (LUCC) study under the International Geosphere Biosphere Program (IGBP) is a major initiative in this regard. Changes in land use and hence in vegetation cover, due to climatic change and human activity, affect surface water and energy budgets directly through plant transpiration, surface albedo, emissivity and roughness. They also affect primary production and, therefore, the carbon cycle. Thus, there is a need for spatial and temporal characterization of vegetation cover at different scales, from the global and continental scale to the local patch scale. Satellite remote sensing provides detailed information regarding the spatial distribution and extent of land use changes in the landscape. Meghalaya, in north-east India, is one of the most important, biologically rich landscapes. Degradational activities, namely shifting cultivation, clear felling of forests for timber, and mining, have altered the natural landscape to a great extent. Because of these increased anthropogenic activities the natural landscape has been modified which has resulted in a fragmented landscape with poor species composition. These changes in the landscape were analysed using IRS 1A, 1B and Landsat Multi-Spectral Scanner (MSS) data during the period 1980-1995. The vegetation type maps were prepared by a visual interpretation technique in order to study the land cover dynamics pattern in Meghalaya. © 2001 Taylor & Francis Ltd.",,"Biodiversity; Climate change; Degradation; Land use; Transpiration; Vegetation; Landscape cover dynamics; Remote sensing; climate change; human activity; land use change; Landsat multispectral scanner; remote sensing; vegetation cover; India; Meghalaya",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,01431161,,,,"English","Int.

All these account for a large variation of the obtained accuracy. Additionally, in most reports inadequate information is given to convert statistically results from one study to the other. Since very few studies, such as Hyyppä et al., exist where various remote sensing data sources and methods are verified in the same test site, much of the knowledge of the applicability of various data sources and methods for forest inventory has to be obtained by studies carried out in different tests sites. However, there is a single parameter, stand size, affecting strongly comparisons of forestry inventory results. The effect of stand size on the accuracy of remote sensing-based standwise forest inventory has not been reported extensively. The most dramatic changes occur at the level where stands are small. Not surprisingly, stand size has been successfully utilized as an auxiliary parameter in some studies. This paper describes how the accuracy of estimation is influenced by the stand size. Both spaceborne and airborne data are used in order to show that the effect is not just based on large pixel sizes or the effects of border pixels in spaceborne data. The accuracy of the following remote sensing data, SPOT Pan & XS, Landsat TM, ERS-1/2 SAR PRI & SLC, and airborne data from imaging spectrometer (AISA) is verified as a function of stand size in the range 1 to 20 ha. The paper presents curves that assist in converting results from one stand size to another and compares results of some studies in different test sites. Stand size seems to explain most of the variability of the results; however, for detailed comparison, more carefully described results are needed. Recommendations to design future forest studies are given in order to help the statistical conversion of results from one study to another.","Coherence; Forest; Forest biomass estimation; Stand size; Synthetic aperture radar (SAR)","Biomass; Imaging techniques; Remote sensing; Spectrometers; Synthetic aperture radar; Forest inventory; Forestry; Biomass; Forestry; Remote Sensing","Academy of Finland","Manuscript received April 18, 2000; revised May 14, 2001.

The investigation is prompted by the need for obtaining spatially distributed data on LAI to be used as input for carbon modelling of northern boreal forests. Detailed field data have been collected in a coniferous forest area in Uppland, central Sweden, dominated by Norway spruce and Scots pine. A forest canopy reflectance model (Kuusk and Nilson, 2000) has been used to simulate stand reflectances in the Landsat ETM+ wavelength bands as a means of investigating the theoretical reflectance response to LAI changes. The analysis shows that the response to changes in LAI is strongest in the visible wavelength bands, particularly Channel 3, whereas only weak response is noted in the NIR band and for some vegetation indices [simple ratio (SR) and NDVI]. Modelled reflectances are influenced by various other factors, particularly ground reflectance and leaf biochemical properties. Observed reflectances from the Landsat ETM+ sensor have been compared with reflectance modelling results and with field-based LAI estimates. The results indicate that LAI estimation using inverse canopy reflectance modelling may be difficult, given the large number of input parameters required and the current level of uncertainty in these parameters. Statistical relationships between LAI and observed ETM+ reflectances are strongest in ETM+ Channel 7. © 2001 Elsevier Science Inc.

MERIS is a fully programmable imaging spectrometer, however a standard 15-channel band set will be transmitted for each 300 m pixel (over land while over the ocean the pixels will be aggregated to 1200 m spatial resolution) covering visible and near-infrared wavelengths. Since MERIS is a multidisciplinary sensor providing data that can be input into ecosystem models at various scales, we studied MERIS's performance relative to the scale of observation using simulated datasets degraded to various spatial resolutions in the range of 6-300 m. Algorithms to simulate MERIS data using airborne imaging spectrometer datasets were presented, including a case study from DAIS (i.e. Digital Airborne Imaging Spectrometer) 79-channel imaging spectrometer data acquired on 8 July 1997 over the Le Peyne test site in southern France. For selected target endmembers garrigue, maquis, mixed oak forest, pine forest and bare agricultural field, regions-of-interest (ROI) were defined in the DAIS scene. For each of the endmembers, the vegetation index values in the corresponding ROI is calculated for the MERIS data at the spatial resolutions ranging from 6 to 300 m. We applied the NDVI, PVI, WDVI, SAVI, MSAVI, MSAVI2 and GEMI vegetation indices. Above-ground biomass (AGB) was estimated in the field and derived from the DAIS image and the MERIS datasets (6-300 m spatial resolution). The vegetation indices are shown to be constant with the spatial scale of observation. The strongest correlation between the MERIS and DAIS NDVI is obtained when using a linear model with an offset of 0.15 (r=0.31). A Pearson correlation matrix between AGB measured in the field and each spectral band reveals a modest but significant (p<0.05) correlation for most spectral bands. When mathematical functions are fitted through the NDVI and biomass data, an exponential fit shows the extinction and saturation at larger vegetation biomass values. The correlation between biomass and NDVI for DAIS as well as for the MERIS simulated dataset is modest. Further research is required to analyse the scale effects that limit the correlation between field and image AGB estimates. © 2001 Taylor & Francis.",,"Biomass; Ecosystems; Forestry; Sensors; Imaging spectrometers; Remote sensing; aboveground biomass; MERIS; spatial variation; vegetation index; (South); France",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,01431161,,,,"English","Int.

In this study, we present a biosphere modeling analysis designed to ascertain the interactions of global data drivers for estimating biogenic isoprene emissions. We have integrated generalized isoprene emission algorithms into a process-based simulation model of ecosystem carbon fluxes, the NASA-CASA (Carnegie-Ames-Stanford Approach) model. This new modeling approach for predicting isoprene emissions operates on scales designed to directly link regional and global satellite data sets with estimates of ecosystem carbon cycling, hydrology, and related biogeochemistry. The NASA-CASA model results indicate that the annual isoprene flux from terrestrial plant sources is 559TgC. Three ecosystem types, broadleaf evergreen forest, dry tropical forest, and wooded grassland (savanna), account for approximately 80% of these global vegetation isoprene emissions. Based on analyses to improve understanding of the relative influence of climatic (e.g., light and temperature) versus biotic (NPP) controllers on predicted isoprene emission estimates, it appears that the largest portion of total biogenic flux to the global atmosphere is emitted from ecosystems that are mainly light-limited for isoprene emissions. These modeling results imply that, along with better process understanding of base emission factor controls for volatile organic compounds, improvements in global fields of solar surface radiation fluxes in warm climate zones will be needed to reduce major uncertainties in isoprene source fluxes.

The study area is located in central Spain with a surface area of about 10 km x 10 km and showing important desertification hazards. The objective of the paper is to establish the mapping of vineyard areas by remote sensing techniques and to establish relationships between the spectral signature and agronomical parameters (biomass, percent of cover, etc.). For these objectives, several vegetation classes have been defined (vineyards, cereals, fallow, olives and forest) and multi-temporal Landsat-5 Thematic Mapper images were used with the maximum likelihood classification method and masking techniques. The results were checked by ground truth and by existing vegetation cover maps (1 : 25 000) and show in general a good correspondence between both information sources. Moreover, these results have permitted to define new vineyard categories like abandoned vineyards and young vineyards that explain the difference between the classification results for vineyards and the ground truth. The later stage of the study pays special attention to the correlation of the agronomical parameters, such as the height of the crop and biomass with the spectral signature of the vineyards represented by the normalized index NDVI, using multi-temporal Landsat images between May and July that comprehend the phenological evolution of the vineyards. Good correlation coefficients (r=0.86 and r=0.90) were obtained successively for the biomass, height and (r=0.82) for the vegetation cover surface. Finally, maps representing the spatial distribution of these parameters were generated for 14 July (period of time when the vineyard is most developed) using the adjustment previously obtained between the NDVI of the vineyard and these parameters.",,"Biomass; Classification (of information); Forestry; Mapping; Classification methods; Cultivation; classification; desertification; Landsat thematic mapper; mapping; vegetation cover; vineyard; Spain",,,,,,,,,,,,"Lanjeri, S.; Department de Thermodinàmica, Spain",,"Taylor and Francis Ltd",01431161,,IJSED,,"English","Int.

In the present contribution several estimates of forest biomass are compared for the Brazilian Amazon, based on spatial interpolations of direct measurements, relationships to climatic variables, and remote sensing data. Three questions were posed: First, do the methods yield similar estimates? Second, do they yield similar spatial patterns of distribution of biomass? And, third, what factors need most attention if we are to predict more accurately the distribution of forest biomass over large areas? The answer to the first two questions is that estimates of biomass for Brazil's Amazonian forests (including dead and belowground biomass) vary by more than a factor of two, from a low of 39 PgC to a high of 93 PgC. Furthermore, the estimates disagree as to the regions of high and low biomass. The lack of agreement among estimates confirms the need for reliable determination of aboveground biomass over large areas. Potential methods include direct measurement of biomass through forest inventories with improved allometric regression equations, dynamic modelling of forest recovery following observed stand-replacing disturbances, and estimation of aboveground biomass from airborne or satellite-based instruments sensitive to the vertical structure plant canopies.","Amazonia; Biomass; Carbon; Deforestation; Land-use change; Spatial variability; Tropical forests","biomass; carbon sequestration; deforestation; estimation method; land use change; spatial distribution; tropical forest; Brazil",,,,,,,,,,,,"Houghton, R.A.; The Woods Hole Research Center, PO Box 296, Woods Hole, MA 02543, United States; email: rhoughton@whrc.org",,,13541013,,,,"English","Global Change Biol.",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0034783125

Data are analyzed using detailed ground truth measurements available on both sites. The backscattering coefficient is strongly correlated to characteristics of the tree trunk. Signal saturation is not observed up to 900 m3/ha. However, the sensitivity to the volume is high in the range of 0-500 M3/ha (e.g., 1 to 1.5 dB for 50 m3/ha), whereas it is reduced beyond 500 m3/ha (&lt; 0.5 dB for 50 m3/ha). The experimental analysis is supported by theoretical modeling using a coherent backscatter model based on the distorted Born approximation coupled with a tree growth model giving a fine and precise description of the trees at both sites. The modeling results show that the trunk is the main scatterer, but that, when the branch dimensions are not insignificant compared to trunk dimension, branch scattering needs to be accounted for. However, since the two species under study are both coniferous, branch dimensions are relatively small compared to trunk dimension. This explains no significant differences observed in the backscatter behavior between both sites, except for mature stands with low stem density. Finally, the effect of topography is investegated both experimentally, using using a digital elevation model (DEM), and theoretically with the coherent model. The loss of sensitivity to stem volume due to slope is clearly demonstrated and explained by the decrease of the dihedral trunk-ground interaction as the slope increases.",,"Backscattering; Correlation detectors; Radar imaging; Remote sensing; Airborne imaging radar; Coherent all-radio band sensing; Digital elevation model; Synthetic aperture radar",,"Manuscript received October 16, 2000; revised August 7, 2001.

The Polessie district, a typical rural area located close to Chernobyl, was chosen as reference for the development of a GIS-based multidisciplinary approach combining maps of soil resources and 137Cs deposits, modelling of SRC biomass production and estimations of 137Cs soil-to-wood transfer. From an agronomic viewpoint, the very dry sandy podzolic soils in the reference area are not suitable for SRC growing because they cannot supply adequate water for SRC during the early summer period. Moreover, on the other soil types, both careful weeding and water supply during the early months after plantation are required, until both leaf cover and root system are sufficiently developed. From the radio-ecological viewpoint, and according to the local legislation, the SRC biomass produced on loamy sand, sandy loam and loamy soils is suitable for firewood. SRC biomass from the highly productive peaty soils (39.4% of the land area of Polessie) may also be used but only if its conversion into heat or electricity is carefully managed. From an economic viewpoint, due to the very low local prices for fossil fuels, the gasification of SRC wood is at present not economically competitive with fossil fuels in Ukraine. Only strong political will and incentives could favour the implementation of bioenergy routes through subsidies and a major reorganisation of the energy market. © 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Studying laser waveforms for such plant canopies is needed for the advanced retrieval of three-dimensional (3-D) canopy structure parameters from the vegetation canopy lidar (VCL) mission. For discontinuous plant canopies, a hybrid geometric optical and radiative transfer (GORT) model describing the effects of 3-D canopy structure parameters of discrete canopies on the radiation environment has been modified for use with lidar. The GORT model is first used to describe the canopy lidar waveforms as a function of canopy structure parameters and then validated using scanning lidar imager of canopies by echo recovery (SLICER) data collected in conifer forests in central Canada during the boreal ecosystem-atmosphere study (BOREAS). Model simulations show that the clumping in natural vegetation, such as leaves clustering into tree crowns causes larger gap probability and smaller waveforms for discontinuous plant canopies than for horizontally homogeneous plant canopies. Ignoring the clumping effect can result in significantly lower values for the estimated foliage amount in the profile and in turn lower estimated biomass. Because of clumping, only the gap probability and apparent vertical projected foliage profile can be directly retrieved from the canopy lidar data. The retrieval is sensitive to the ratio of the volume backscattering coefficients of the vegetation and background, and this ratio depends on canopy architecture as well as foliage spectral characteristics. Extensions of the GORT model from single-layered canopies to include multilayered ones are also explored.","Geometric optical and radiative transfer (GORT) model; Heterogeneous plant canopies; Lidar waveforms","Biomass; Computer simulation; Ecosystems; Forestry; Geometrical optics; Mathematical models; Optical radar; Probability; Three dimensional; Vegetation; Boreal ecosystem-atmosphere study; Geometric optical and radiative transfer; Lidar waveforms; Scanning lidar imager of canopies by echo recovery; Vegetation canopy lidar; Remote sensing","National Aeronautics and Space Administration, NASA: NAS597160","Manuscript received July 31, 2000; revised December 27, 2000.

Empirical linear relationships, such as ρ0.469 = 0.25ρ2.1; ρ0.555 = 0.33ρ2.1; ρ0.645 = 0.5ρ2.1; and ρ0.645 = 0.66ρt.6, were found to be statistically significant and consistent with previous findings. Based on the above relationships, a modified vegetation index (VI) is proposed and named Aerosol Free Vegetation Index (AFRI). Two versions of this VI are formulated as: AFRI1.6 = (ρNIR - 0.66ρ1.6)/(ρNIR + 0.66ρ1.6) and AFRI2.1 = (ρNIR - 0. 5ρ2.1)/(ρNIR + 0.5ρ2.1). It is shown that under clear sky conditions, the AFRIs (and especially AFRI2.1) closely resemble the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and their values are almost identical. The advantage of the derived AFRIs, based on the ability of the SWIR bands is to penetrate the atmospheric column even when aerosols such as smoke or sulfates exist. Consequently, these indices have a major application in assessing vegetation in the presence of smoke, anthropogenic pollution, or volcanic plumes. This was demonstrated by applying the AFRI for a biomass burned forest in Brazil. Limited success of these indices is expected in case of dust due to presence of larger particles that are of similar size to the wavelength and therefore not transparent at 2.1 μm. The AFRIs can be implemented to data from any sensor that has the SWIR bands. Currently, the most commonly used of such instruments are the Landsat - Thematic Mapper (TM) and Advanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+), Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MODIS), Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection (ASTER), and Japanese Earth Resources Satellite-Optical System (JERS-OPS). Although the AFRI2.1 was demonstrated to perform better than the AFRI1.6, the latter still can be used for the same application in conjunction with instruments that have onboard only the 1.6-μm band, such as Systeme Probatoire d'Observation del la Terre (SPOT4)-VEGETATION, Indian Remote Sensing (IRS-1C/D), and Resource-21. © 2001 Elsevier Science Inc.

One model, 3-PGS, is a production model driven by remote sensing data, running at monthly time steps, while the other, BIOME-BGC, is a complex eco-physiological model run at daily time steps. Both models include subroutines for predicting the interception of radiation and its dissipation as energy for evaporating water and the absorbed fraction that is photosynthetically active (400-700 nm). The models differ in a number of ways, including the estimation of canopy dynamics, calculation of respiration, use of growth modifiers and below ground mechanisms. In 3-PGS, canopy dynamics are derived from remote sensing inputs, and autotrophic respiration is assumed a constant fraction of gross photosynthesis = 0.53; in BIOME-BGC, the canopy biomass is accumulated through allocation, with respiration a function of live biomass, temperature, and nitrogen content. BIOME-BGC includes decomposition and nitrogen mineralization subroutines, while 3-PGS incorporates these processes through an index of soil fertility. Plot-based information was available at each site on species composition, site productivity, phenology, and seasonal trends in plant water relations. Long-term averages of minimum/maximum temperature and precipitation were extrapolated from local meteorological stations and converted into estimates of solar radiation, daytime vapor pressure deficits, and frequency of subfreezing temperatures for the sites, which ranged in elevation from 550 to 2135 m and had varying slopes and aspects. State-wide soil survey data were interpreted to estimate soil water holding capacity and fertility. Satellite-derived data were used to drive 3-PGS and to validate predictions of leaf area by BIOME-BCG. The two models gave similar annual estimates of total net primary production (r2 = 0.85, slope = 0.64, intercept: 2.26 Mg ha-1 year-1) but differed in their presentation of photosynthetic activity seasonally. 3-PGS has a suboptimal temperature function that provides more realistically limits on photosynthesis during the dormant season than assumed by BIOME-BGC. BIOME-BGC predicted seasonal variation in the ratio of autotrophic respiration to gross photosynthesis from 0.4 to 0.7, but over the year, the average was similar to that assumed by 3-PGS (0.58 ± 0.05). We discovered that Landsat imagery with 30 m spatial resolution was reasonably correlated with leaf area indices as predicted by the BIOME-BGC model, but a variation still occurred associated with small areas where outcrops of serpentine restricted canopy development. © 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

Remote sensing is often the only practical means of acquiring information on forest biomass but has not always been used successfully. Here the conventional approaches to the estimation of forest biomass from remotely sensed data were evaluated relative to techniques based on the application of artificial neural networks. Together these approaches were used to estimate and map the biomass of tropical forests in north-eastern Borneo from Lansat TM data. The neural networks were found to be particularly suited to the application. A basic multilayer perceptron network, for example, provided estimates of biomass that were strongly correlated with those measured in the field (r = 0.80). Moreover, these estimates were more strongly correlated with biomass than those derived from 230 conventional vegetation indices, including the widely used normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI).","Borneo; Land cover change; Landsat TM; NDVI; Neural network; Remote sensing; Tropical forest biomass","artificial neural network; biomass; Landsat thematic mapper; mapping; NDVI; remote sensing; tropical forest; Borneo",,,,,,,,,,,,"Foody, G.M.; Department of Geography, , Highfield, Southampton SO17 1BJ, United Kingdom; email: g.m.foody@soton.ac.uk",,,1466822X,,GEBIF,,"English","Global Ecol.

At plot scales over a 20-year period, forest inventory data (representing areas < 750 ha) have shown stands to be accumulating above-ground biomass pantropically while displaying signs of increasing turnover. To assess whether or not such disequilibrium is manifest at broader spatial scales (i.e. coarser grain sizes and larger extents), we performed a change detection analysis of landscape texture (i.e. the organization of reflective properties), in satellite images of closed-canopy tropical rain forests considered to be anthropically undisturbed. Here we show that fractal properties of pixel spectral values depicting low and high levels of photosynthetic activity underwent significant shifts from the 1970s to the 1980s. Following expectations for aggrading forests, canopy texture became more random throughout the tropics. Although subject to periodic disturbance events such as natural exogenic perturbations and/or synchronous die-off, which should produce no consistent trend, these forested landscapes across the globe exhibited similar dynamics at fine temporal (decadal) intervals. Such biophysical changes (representing areas > 1000 000 ha) directly affect atmospheric boundary layer conditions and could have implications with respect to biodiversity and carbon cycling in these systems.","Canopy; Fractal; Global change; Lacunarity; Satellite imagery; Spatial pattern; Texture; Tropical rain forest","forest canopy; fractal analysis; remote sensing; texture; tropical forest",,,,,,,,,,,,"Weishampel, J.F.; Department of Biology, , Orlando, Florida 32816-2368, United States; email: jweisham@mail.ucf.edu",,,1466822X,,GEBIF,,"English","Global Ecol.

They determine radiation regimes and influence mass and energy exchange with the atmosphere. The evaluation of leaf area in conifer stands is particularly challenging due to their open nature and clumping on the needle, shoot and tree scale. The overall objective of our study was to characterize leaf area index (LAI) (Lh, m2 half-surface area foliage m-2 ground) in the vicinity of our old-growth and 14-year-old ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa, var. Laws) eddy covariance flux sites, with future plans to scale from the flux sites to the pine region using ecosystem models and remote sensing. From the combination of optical and canopy geometry measurements, sapwood and litter-fall measurements, and one- and three-dimensional (3-D) models, we evaluated the variation in estimates of Lh in a mixed-age stand at the old-growth flux site. We also compared sapwood area estimates from a local allometric equation with LAI-2000 estimates that have been corrected for clumping and the interception of light by stems and branches (Lhc, m2 half-surface area m-2 ground) across a range of age classes and stand densities of ponderosa pine forests along a 15 km swath in Central Oregon that encompassed the flux sites. In the old-growth stand, the litter-fall and sapwood estimates tended to be higher than the optical and 3-D radiative transfer model estimates. Across the 15 km east-west gradient from the crest of the Cascade Mountains, Lhc was typically lower than the sapwood estimates (Lhsw; slope 0.38). The Lhc data, as well as aboveground production estimates for the 17 pine plots will be useful for scaling flux measurements to the region using ecosystem models that have been validated with these data. © 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.","Canopy architecture; Carbon exchange; Energy exchange; Leaf area; Pinus ponderosa; Radiative transfer; Soil-vegetation-atmosphere transfer (SVAT) modeling","canopy exchange; forest management; leaf area index; pine; spatial distribution; United States; Coniferophyta; Pinus ponderosa","National Aeronautics and Space Administration, NASA","This study was funded by NASA (grant no.

For example, in Finland, more than 30% of the first pulse data of laser scanning reflect directly from the ground without any interaction with the canopy. By increasing the number of pulses, it is possible to have samples from each individual tree and also from the gaps between the trees. Basically, this means that several laser pulses can be recorded per m2. This allows detailed investigation of forest areas and the creation of a three-dimensional (3-D) tree height model. Tree height model can be calculated from the digital terrain and crown models both obtained with the laser scanner data. By analyzing the 3-D tree height model by using image vision methods, e.g., segmentation, it is possible to locate individual trees, estimate individual tree heights, crown area, and, by using that data, to derive the stem diameter, number of stems, basal area, and stem volume. The advantage of the method is the capability to measure directly physical dimensions from the trees and use that information to calculate the needed stand attributes. This paper demonstrates for the first time that it is possible to accurately estimate standwise forest attributes, especially stem volume (biomass), using high-pulse-rate laser scanners to provide data, from which individual trees can be detected and characteristics of trees such as height, location, and crown dimensions can be determined. That information can be applied to provide estimates for larger areas (stands). Using the new method, the following standard errors were demonstrated for mean height, basal area and stem volume: 1.8 m (9.9%), 2.0 m2/ha (10.2%), and 18.5 m3/ha (10.5%), respectively. The precision obtained is better than that in conventional standwise forest inventories.","Forest inventory; Laser; Remote sensing","Forestry; Image analysis; Image retrieval; Image segmentation; Laser applications; Laser pulses; Mathematical models; Scanning; Three dimensional; Forest inventory; Image vision methods; Laser scanning; Remote sensing","Academy of Finland","Manuscript received April 12, 2000; revised October 20, 2000.

Evaluation of biological and environmental factors determining variability of RUE for daily total gross photosynthesis within and among species suggests a biophysically based approach for estimating daily total gross photosynthesis using satellite and ancillary data. Calculations have been done using leaf photosynthesis and canopy characteristics derived from field measurements for six cultivated herbaceous and 12 uncultivated (herbaceous and needle leaf and broadleaf woody) species, and mixed species stands of temperate deciduous forest and tropical moist and dry forests. These data are for 65 canopies, divided about equally between cultivated and uncultivated species, and the leaf area index varies between O.6 and 9.5. A model for instantaneous canopy photosynthesis, considering sunlit and shaded leaves, variation of maximum rate of leaf photosynthesis within the canopy, and a solution of the radiative transfer equation for propagation of direct and diffuse PAR, is numerically integrated in space (angular variation of radiances and depth within the canopy) and time (diurnal variation) to obtain daily total gross photosynthesis and IPAR for varied incident irradiances. The results show that the maximum rate of leaf photosynthesis and magnitudes of direct and diffuse irradiance incident on the canopy are the major factors determining RUE for unstressed conditions. Also, while woody species on the average have lower RUE, they are found to utilize diffuse radiation more efficiently than cultivated species. Comparison of calculated RUE with observations for 10 cultivated species in varied environment gave differences of -23% to +11% for individual species, but aggregately they have almost equal coefficient of variation (∼25%) and their averages differ by -6% (underestimation). Monthly and annual gross photosynthesis determined using satellite and ancillary data are obtained for rain forest (in Brazil), boreal forest (in Canada), and cropland (in the United States). Annual photosynthesis calculated using satellite data for the three biomes differed from that determined from field measurements by -29% to +15%, averaging to +6%. The above error estimates for RUE and photosynthesis are obtained without calibrating any model parameter. ©2001 Published by Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd.",,"canopy reflectance; forest canopy; photosynthesis; remote sensing; satellite data; Brazil; Canada; United States; Rickettsia sp.

These forest attribute maps derived with remote sensing data, along with a conventional soils map, were used to identify the initial conditions for forest ecosystem model simulations. Using this information along with ecosystem model results enabled the development of predictive reaps of est development.

This sub-pixel scale information has been shown to consistently provide significantly improved estimates of forest biophysical information such as biomass, leaf area index (LAI) and net primary productivity (NPP) compared to that provided by the normalized difference vegetation index (ND VI) using airborne and satellite imagery. However, a number of vegetation indices (VIs) have been proposed as an improvement to NDVI. In this paper, ten different VIs were used to predict forest biophysical parameters, and then compared with results obtained from SMA using airborne multispectral data from the NASA COVER Project, Superior National Forest, Minnesota USA. This data set was acquired over a range of solar zenith angles at the spatial resolution and spectral bands of the Landsat Thematic Mapper sensor. The following vegetation indices were derived from the remotely sensed data: NDVI, SR, MSR, RDVI, WDVI, GEMI, NLI, and three different soil-adjusted vegetation indices (SAVI, SAVI-1, SAVI-2). Results were obtained at solar zenith angles of 30°, 45° and 60° for biomass, LAI, NPP, DBH, stem density, and basal fraction. In all cases, SMA shadow fraction provided significantly better results than any vegetation indices, with improvements on the order of 20% compared to the best vegetation index results. In most cases, one or more of the new vegetation indices provided a small to moderate improvement compared to NDVI, with WDVI and SAVI-1 performing best amongst the VIs, likely due to the inclusion of background reflectance. It is concluded that while different VIs can provide some improvements over NDVI, these appear to be functionally equivalent and fundamentally similar in a first-order sense in terms of their ability to predict forest biophysical parameters, which is surpassed by approaches based on sub-pixel image decomposition such as spectral mixture analysis and canopy optical reflectance modelling. © 2001 Canadian Journal of Remote Sensing/Journal canadien de télédétection.",,"Biomass; Forestry; Image segmentation; Infrared imaging; Radar imaging; Regression analysis; Vegetation; Boreal forest cfl Normalized difference vegetation index; Leaf area index; Net primary productivity cfl Stem density cfl Basal fraction; Spectral mixture analysis; Vegetation index; Remote sensing; Basal Area; Biomass; Forests; Plants; Regression Analysis; Stems","University of Lethbridge, U of L; Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada, NSERC; Natural Resources Canada, NRCan","Part of this research was performed while Dr. Peddle was a Fulbright Faculty Senior Scholar on sabbatical study leave with the Joint Center for Earth Systems Technology, University of Maryland, Baltimore County and the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center.

Many of these models can be driven with information derived from satellite sensors. In particular, a large number use the normalized difference vegetation index to infer spatial and temporal shifts in the fraction of visible light intercepted (fφp.a) by vegetation. We utilized a simplified process model (Physiological Principles Predicting Growth from Satellites), initialized with Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer normalized difference vegetation index-derived estimates of fφp.a, to estimate at monthly time steps photosynthesis, respiration, and aboveground growth of forest vegetation within a 54,000 km2 region in southwestern Oregon. We had data available from 755 permanent survey plots to provide an independent estimate of forest growth capacity. In addition, we took advantage of a satellite-derived classification of 14 major forest types to investigate the extent that generalizations might be made about their respective productive capacities. From weather stations and statewide soil surveys, we extrapolated and transformed these sources of data into those required to drive the model (solar radiation, temperature extremes, vapor pressure deficit, and precipitation) and initialize conditions (soil water holding capacity and soil fertility). Within the mountainous region we found considerable variation existed within each 1-km2 pixel centered on each of the survey plots. Even by excluding comparisons where local variation was high, model predictions of forest growth compared poorly with those estimated from ground survey (r2 = 0.4). This variation was only partly attributed to variation in canopy fφp.a. Local variation in climate and soils played an equal if not greater role. When the sample plots were stratified into 14 broad forest types, within which growth potential varied similarly (coefficient of variation for each of the 14 types averaged 6%), a good relation between predicted and measured forest growth capacity across all types resulted (r2 = 0.82, P≤0.01, SE = 1.2 m3 ha-1yr-1). The implications of these analyses suggest that: (1) models should be rigorously tested before applying across landscapes; (2) accuracy in locating plots and in extrapolating data limits spatial resolution; (3) soil surveys in mountainous regions are inaccurate and difficult to interpret; (4) mapped vegetation classifications provide a useful level of stratification; and (5) remotely sensed estimates of canopy nitrogen status and biomass increment and canopy nitrogen status are needed to improve and validate regional assessment of growth.

K7L 3N6, Canada","Sustainable forest management requires objective measures of forest condition and productivity. To help develop these measures, this study uses a multispectral remote sensing approach to explore the structural characteristics and physiological condition of vegetation following forest disturbance. The disturbance examined was three silvicultural practices (selection, shelterwood and clearcut) in an over-mature maple forest in the Algoma Highlands near Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario. Since the quality of remote sensing data is scale-dependent, studies must be designed with some consideration of the spatial characteristics of the variable of interest. Variables investigated here included aboveground organization of vegetation (structure), and physiological condition of this vegetation following different silvicultural practices. Data were acquired at three altitudes (1000, 2000, and 3000 m), using a Compact Airborne Spectrographic Imager (casi). To uncover the scale and pattern of variation for each altitude, semivariogram analysis was applied. Range and sill parameters were derived front semivariogram analysis of overall scene variance using the first principal component (PCA). Variance in physiological condition was analyzed front spectral red-edge inflection point wavelength (λp) data. The resulting variogram analysis indicated spatial resolutions of approximately 9.0 m and 5.0 m for the PCA and λp data, respectively. The sill and range parameters were also successfully correlated to critical forest parameters such as biomass, stocking and crown area. Obtaining a measure of the scale and pattern of variation was a precursor to the use of spectral information for analyzing the relationship of canopy reflectance to leaf-based measures (e.g., chlorophyll and other pigment concentrations) and biophysical features (e.g., crown cover and biomass). Relationships were examined using an ordination technique known as redundancy analysis (RDA). The RDA biplots uncovered a significant relationship between canopy opening and spectral indices. An improved understanding of resolution and condition related to forest disturbance was achieved. © Canadian Journalof Remote Sensing/Journal canadien de teledetection.","Bioindicators; Canopy; CASI; Chlorophyll; Physiology; Redundancy analysis; Silviculture","Biomass; Chlorophyll; Data reduction; Forestry; Hardwoods; Image analysis; Vegetation; Airborne spectrographic imager; Remote sensing; Forests; Silviculture","Informed Medical Decisions Foundation, IMDF; Ministry of Natural Resources","The authors gratefully acknowledge the financial support provided for this research through the Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources; the Centre for Research in Earth and Space Technology (CRESTech), and Geomatics for Informed Decisions (GEOIDE).

Our knowledge of fine-scale physiological and ecological processes comes from a variety of measurements, ranging from forest plot inventories to remote sensing, made at spatial resolutions considerably smaller than the large scale at which global ecosystem models are defined. In this paper, we describe a new individual-based, terrestrial biosphere model, which we label the ecosystem demography model (ED). We then introduce a general method for scaling stochastic individual-based models of ecosystem dynamics (gap models) such as ED to large scales. The method accounts for the fine-scale spatial heterogeneity within an ecosystem caused by stochastic disturbance events, operating at scales down to individual canopy-tree-sized gaps. By conditioning appropriately on the occurrence of these events, we derive a size-and age-structured (SAS) approximation for the first moment of the stochastic ecosystem model. With this approximation, it is possible to make predictions about the large scales of interest from a description of the fine-scale physiological and population-dynamic processes without simulating the fate of every plant individually. We use the SAS approximation to implement our individual-based biosphere model over South America from 15° N to 15° S, showing that the SAS equations are accurate across a range of environmental conditions and resulting ecosystem types. We then compare the predictions of the biosphere model to regional data and to intensive data at specific sites. Analysis of the model at these sites illustrates the importance of fine-scale heterogeneity in governing large-scale ecosystem function, showing how population and community-level processes influence ecosystem composition and structure, patterns of aboveground carbon accumulation, and net ecosystem production.","Biogeochemical dynamics; Ecosystem dynamics; Ecosystem model; Individual-based model; Moment approximation; Plant community dynamics; Scaling; Size- and age-Structured; South America; Sub-grid scale heterogeneity; Terrestrial; Terrestrial biosphere model; Vegetation dynamics","demography; ecosystem dynamics; heterogeneity; individual-based model; vegetation dynamics",,,,,,,,,,,,"Moorcroft, P.R.; Department of Organismal Biology, , Cambridge, MA 02138, United States; email: prmoorcroft@oeb.harvard.edu",,"Ecological Society of America",00129615,,ECMOA,,"English","Ecol.

Several sensors were evaluated, including (i) single date Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM); (ii) multitemporal Landsat TM; (iii) Airborne Data Acquisition and Registration (ADAR), a sensor with high spatial resolution; (iv) Airborne Visible-Infrared Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS), a sensor with high spectral resolution; and (v) Scanning Lidar Imager of Canopies By Echo Recovery (SLICER), a lidar sensor that directly measures the height and canopy structure of forest vegetation. To evaluate the ability of each of the sensors to predict stand structure attributes, we assembled a data set consisting of 92 field plots within the Willamette National Forest in the vicinity of the H.J. Andrews Experimental Forest. Stand structure attributes included age, basal area, aboveground biomass, mean diameter at breast height (DBH) of dominant and codominant stems, mean and standard deviation of the DBH of all stems, maximum height, and the density of stems with DBH greater than 100 cm. SLICER performed better than any other remote sensing system in its predictions of forest structural attributes. The performance of the imaging sensors (TM, multitemporal TM, ADAR, and AVIRIS) varied with respect to which forest structural variables were being examined. For one group of variables there was little difference in the ability of the these sensors to predict forest structural attributes. For the remaining variables, we found that multitemporal TM was as or more effective than either ADAR or AVIRIS. These results indicate that multitemporal TM should be investigated as an alternative to either hyperspectral or hyperspatial sensors, which are more expensive and more difficult to process than multitemporal Landsat TM.",,"environmental monitoring; forest inventory; remote sensing; vegetation mapping; Oregon; United States; Abies; Pseudotsuga menziesii",,,,,,,,,,,,"Lefsky, M.A.; USDA Forest Service, 3200 SW Jefferson Way, Corvallis, OR 97331, United States; email: lefsky@fsl.orst.edu",,"National Research Council of Canada",00455067,,CJFRA,,"English","Can.

Forests will be protected when people who are deciding the fate of forests conclude than the conservation of forests is more beneficial, e.g. generates higher incomes or has cultural or social values, than their clearance. If this is not the case, forests will continue to be cleared and converted. In the future, the WRCF may be protected only by focused attention. The future policy options may include strategies for strong protection measures, the raising of public awareness about the value of forests, and concerted actions for reducing pressure on forest lands by providing alternatives to forest exploitation to meet the growing demands of forest products. Many areas with low population densities offer an opportunity for conservation if appropriate steps are taken now by the national governments and international community. This opportunity must be founded upon the increased public and government awareness that forests have vast importance to the welfare of humans and ecosystems' services such as biodiversity, watershed protection, and carbon balance. Also paramount to this opportunity is the increased scientific understanding of forest dynamics and technical capability to install global observation and assessment systems. High-resolution satellite data such as Landsat 7 and other technologically advanced satellite programs will provide unprecedented monitoring options for governing authorities. Technological innovation can contribute to the way forests are protected.

SAR sensors at different wavelengths and with different polarimetric capabilities are being used in remote sensing of the earth. The value of an analysis of backscattered energy alone is limited due to ambiguities in the possible ecological factor configurations causing the signal. From two SAR images taken from similar viewing positions with a short time-lag, interference between the two waves can be observed. By subtracting the two phases of the signals, it is feasible to eliminate the random contribution of the scatterers to the phase. The interferometric correlation and the interferometric phase contain additional information on the three-dimensional structure of the scattering elements in the imaged area.

In this study, specific-site measurements, regional databases, satellite observations, and models were used to test the hypothesis that New Zealand's terrestrial ecosystems are C neutral because C uptake by planted forests and scrub is roughly balanced by C losses from indigenous forests and soils. Net ecosystem C balance was estimated from the difference between net primary production (NPP) and heterotrophic soil respiration. The productivity portion of the CASA model and NOAA-AVHRR imagery were used to estimate national NPP (128 ± 14 Mt C per year). Main sources of uncertainty were the coarse spatial scale (1 X 1 km2 grid cells), and the general lack of information on photosynthetically active radiation, light-use efficiency, and below-ground C allocation for the major vegetation types: indigenous and exotic forests, scrub, and grasslands (improved, unimproved and tussock). Total soil CO2-C production predicted from an Arrhenius-type function coupled to climate and land-cover data was 380 ± 30 Mt C per year, suggesting that New Zealand's terrestrial ecosystems may be either (a) a net source of atmospheric CO2 or (b) roughly in C balance if ca. 252 Mt CO2-C per year (66%) can be attributed to roots. Soil moisture limitations on respiration were small, reducing the national value to 365 ± 28 Mt C per year. Differences between NPP and heterotrophic soil respiration were -29 Mt C per year for improved pastures, -8 Mt C per year for indigenous forests, and +4 Mt C per year for planted forests; the large negative value for improved grasslands may be due to under-estimation of NPP and root respiration. Soil C losses to coastal waters, as estimated from a consideration of all the major erosion processes, were ca. 3-11 Mt C per year. These national-scale estimates of ecosystem C balance were in general agreement with those based on plot-scale data for some major ecosystems including planted forests (4 Mt C per year vs 3.7 Mt C per year respectively) and indigenous forest (-8 Mt C per year vs ca. -2.8 Mt C per year, respectively). Poor agreement for forest regenerating after land abandonment (-17 Mt C per year vs +3 Mt C per year) was probably due to an underestimate of NPP at the national scale. Overall, the results suggest that New Zealand is a net C source, despite the fact that some ecosystems are accumulating C. For some land-use types, using the balance between NPP and soil respiration at the national scale to estimate the net ecosystem C balance may be too coarse, and studies of land-use changes at finer spatial scales are needed to reduce uncertainties in national-scale C balance estimates.

Fires are an important landscape disturbance which interact in a complex way with land-use and land-cover change. The objective of this study is to understand the role of fires in vegetation-cover change and, conversely, the role of land use as a controlling factor of fires. Location. The study sites are located in Mato Grosso, Brazil, in Central Africa and on the border between Kenya and Tanzania. Methods. The role of vegetation fire is addressed through a landscape-scale analysis of the spatial association between maps of active fires and maps of land-cover change derived from remote sensing data for the different sites in Africa and South America. Results. The empirical results of this study clearly support the idea that fires have widely varying impacts on land cover in savanna and forest ecosystems. Fires play different roles within the different components of landscape mosaics and at different times of the land-cover change trajectory. The impact of fires on vegetation is mainly controlled by land use. Conclusions. There is thus a need to consider the socioeconomic purpose of biomass burning and the context in which such activities are undertaken. In forest ecosystems, a statistically significant relationship exists between the occurrence of fires and forest-cover changes. One could not conclude however, that fires are always the cause of the change in land cover, nor that fires are a reliable indicator of 'hot spots' of deforestation. Current low spatial resolution information on fire activity derived from remote sensing systems can be prone to inaccuracies due to a poor co-location of fire with respect to land-cover data, and temporal sampling problems affecting fire data.","Biomass burning; Fires; Land-cover change; Landscape disturbance; Remote sensing","disturbance; fire; land use; landscape ecology; vegetation cover; Brazil; Kenya; Tanzania",,,,,,,,,,,,"Eva, H.; Space Applications Institute, , I-21020 Ispra (Varese), Italy",,,03050270,,JBIOD,,"English","J.

Suburban forests have, since ancient times, been places where people have gathered firewood and cultured trees. As a result, the vegetation of suburban forests is only partially natural and continues to change as the forms of human activity in and around them changes. Accurate forecasts of how suburban forests will change are, therefore, an important element in the debate over how to protect them. In this study, a suburban forest was analyzed with laser radar sensing, multi-spectrum scanning, digital photogrammetry analysis, aerial photograph interpretation, and a field survey. Data gathered using these techniques were compiled on a GIS to forecast future changes in the forest. Aerial photographs taken over the past 50 years were analyzed to illuminate changes in the forest over that period. Specifically, comparisons of precise Digital Elevation Models (DEMs) measured by using digital photogrammetry workstations made it possible to estimate growth in forest height. The possible future conversion of such results to estimates of amounts of carbon dioxide consolidated by forests should be very significant for discussions of global environmental problems.","Carbon fixation; Environmental assessment; Forest growth; GIS; Global environment; Photogrammetry; Remote sensing","Geographic information systems; Laser applications; Photogrammetry; Scanning; Vegetation; Laser radar sensing; Forestry; forecasting method; forest; GIS; suburban area; Forestry; GIS; Photogrammetry; Plants; Scanning","Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, MEXT","The authors would like to express special thanks to Professor Dr Nobuhiko Hand at the department of information science and technology, Aichi prefectural university for his orientation of the whole study from the view point of global environmental researches at the beginning.

This has an impact on the Earth's radiation budget, the magnitude of which has not yet been well quantified. Satellite remote sensing is well suited to assessing the area of biomass burning, a prerequisite for estimating emissions at regional and global scales. Commonly used satellite-based techniques for measuring burned areas include thermal hotspot detection and multitemporal NDVI analysis, each having several limitations. Here we present a new, hybrid approach for boreal burned area mapping called HANDS, or hotspot and NDVI differencing synergy. The automated technique was tested using satellite data covering Canada for the 1995 and 1996 fire seasons, and comparing results with official burned area statistics and conventional fire surveys. HANDS computed a national burned forest area of 6.8 million ha in 1995 and 2.0 million ha in 1996, corresponding favorably to Canadian Forest Service estimates of 7.1 million ha and 1.9 million ha, respectively. Moreover, in most cases, the technique accurately delineated the boundaries of individual burns and identified some burns that were missed with conventional mapping. When employed in conjunction with NOAA-AVHRR imagery, HANDS provides a consistent means of mapping large burns (&gt;10 km2), which are characteristic for the boreal forest.

This system provides vertical sounding inside canopy from which can be derived tree height estimations. The objective of this paper is to analyse the validity of these measurements and, then, to study the interest of this kind of sensors for better forest management. The mean and top height estimations give very good results with a relative error of about 6%. The radar measures the backscatter coefficient of the vegetation from which can be estimated other parameters such as stem volume or basal area. The radar backscatter coefficient is found to be sensitive to the biomass in a low to intermediate range of values (0-200 m3/ha), particularly when the canopy backscattering is separated from the ground echo. The estimation of stem volume using a regression with both tree height estimations and backscatter measurements gives satisfying results. Finally, we discuss the interest of this kind of sensor data for an improved and detailed forest management giving an example of application on the evaluation of the variability of the local site index within a stand.",,"estimation method; height; remote sensing; scatterometer; tree; France",,,,,,,,,,,,"Martinez, J.M.; CESBIO, 18, avenue Édouard Belin, 31055 Toulouse, France; email: courriel:martinez@cesbio.cnes.fr",,,00455067,,CJFRA,,"French","Can.

Much of the current research in this area is based on models parameterized for grasslands and broadleaf forests. However, many temperate montane and boreal forests are dominated by conifers, which present unique challenges to modellers. We propose two fundamentally different strategies by which plant canopies optimize solar radiation interception. Laminar canopies (e.g., grasslands, broadleaf trees) are ‘solar panels’ that directly intercept incoming radiant energy. By contrast, conifer canopies are conical anechoic (‘without echo’) surfaces that intercept radiant energy by scattering it through the canopy. The properties of anechoic surfaces are well known in acoustical and electrical engineering, but have not been applied in environmental biophysics. We discuss the physical principles of anechoic surfaces, and demonstrate how these principles apply to conifer trees and canopies. A key feature of anechoic interception is low radiance over all wavelengths, which is an emergent property of the system. Using empirical data from boreal forest stands in Riding Mountain National Park (Manitoba, Canada), we demonstrate that conifer canopies have very low near-infrared radiance compared to laminar broadleaf canopies. Vegetation index values for conifers are thereby reduced, resulting in underestimates of primary productivity and other biophysical parameters. We also discuss the adaptive significance of boreal conifer geometry, and consider factors driving selection of laminar versus anechoic canopy architectures. © 2000, Akadémiai Kiadó, Budapest.","Anechoic surface; Canopy reflectance; Fractal; Landsat; Leaf area index; Primary productivity; Remote sensing; Tree architecture; Vegetation index","Coniferophyta",,,,,,,,,,,,"Walker, D.J.; Department of Botany, Canada; email: djwalkr@cc.umanitoba.ca",,"Akademiai Kiado",15858553,,CEOCA,,"English","Community Ecol.",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-0004630764

Several studies suggest that the terrestrial biosphere is gaining carbon, but these estimates are obtained primarily by indirect methods, and the factors that control terrestrial carbon exchange, its magnitude and primary locations, are under debate. Here we present data of net ecosystem carbon exchange, collected between 1996 and 1998 from 15 European forests, which confirm that many European forest ecosystems act as carbon sinks. The annual carbon balances range from an uptake of 6.6 tonnes of carbon per hectare per year to a release of nearly 1 t C ha-1 yr-1, with a large variability between forests. The data show a significant increase of carbon uptake with decreasing latitude, whereas the gross primary production seems to be largely independent of latitude. Our observations indicate that, in general, ecosystem respiration determines net ecosystem carbon exchange. Also, for an accurate assessment of the carbon balance in a particular forest ecosystem, remote sensing of the normalized difference vegetation index or estimates based on forest inventories may not be sufficient.",,"carbon; atmospheric chemistry; carbon balance; carbon sink; forest; respiration; article; atmosphere; biosphere; climate; ecosystem; Europe; forest; geography; priority journal; vegetation; Atmosphere; Carbon; Ecosystem; Europe; Oxygen; Photosynthesis; Soil; Trees",,,,,,,,,,,,"Valentini, R.; University of Tuscia, , I-01100 Viterbo, Italy; email: rik@unitus.it",,,00280836,,NATUA,"10786790","English","Nature",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0034690165

We developed a method to minimize and quantify non-biological artifacts in NOAA AVHRR satellite data, providing a record of estimated forest phenological variation from 1982-1993 The seasonal NDVI amplitude (a proxy for phenology) increased throughout much of the basin during El Nino periods when rainfall was anomalously low.

To achieve that target, direct human induced activities initiated in the Land-use Change and Forestry sector since 1990, shall be included. However, the wording in the Protocol has caused confusion. The IPCC has been requested to deliver a Special Report on Land-use, Land-use Change and Forestry issues arising from this Protocol. In the present study a limited initial assessment of the implications of alternative interpretations of Afforestation, Reforestation and Deforestation (ARD), addition of the soils compartment, the selection of additional activities, and feasibility of monitoring was done for a limited number of countries. The results show that it is possible to keep the biosphere articles in the Protocol even though we had to make several assumptions concerning for example, areas of application and effectiveness of additional activities. The consequences of alternative interpretations for ARD have a large impact on the countries' assigned amount; varying from a compensation of 26% of total national emissions (Forestry interpretation for Sweden) to an addition of an extra 13% of the emissions (Global interpretation for Australia). Through selection of a large set of additional activities, most of the studied industrialised countries achieve more sequestration than the reduction of emissions they have committed themselves to. Methods for monitoring are available, but there is no one ideal method. Depending on scale and site: a combination of forest inventory with flux measurements and remote sensing is proposed. © Elsevier Science Ltd.","Additional activities; Afforestation; Deforestation; Forests; Kyoto Protocol; Reforestation; Soil carbon",,,,,,,,,,,,,"Nabuurs, G.J.; ALTERRA, , Wageningen, Netherlands; email: g.j.nabuurs@alterra.wag-ur.nl",,"Elsevier BV",14629011,,ESCPF,,"English","Environ.

The results showed a linear relationship between backscattering amplitude and forest stem volume, stem diameter, and tree height. The analysis also showed that the radar signal is strongly affected by ground slope conditions. The root mean square errors from the regression analysis, restricted to forest stands on near-horizontal ground, were found to be 66 m3 ha1, 3.2 cm, and 2.3 m for stem volume, stem diameter, and tree height respectively.

In the more immediate context of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, implementation of the Kyoto Protocol calls for estimates of carbon stocks for a baseline year as well as for subsequent years. Data sources from country level statistics and other ground-based information are based on varying definitions of 'forest' and are consequently problematic for obtaining spatially and temporally consistent carbon stock estimates. By combining two datasets previously derived from the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) at 1 km spatial resolution, we have generated a prototype global map depicting percentage tree cover and associated proportions of trees with different leaf longevity (evergreen and deciduous) and leaf type (broadleaf and needleleaf). The product is intended for use in terrestrial carbon cycle models, in conjunction with other spatial datasets such as climate and soil type, to obtain more consistent and reliable estimates of carbon stocks.

Quantifying plant litter cover is important for interpreting vegetated landscapes and for evaluating the effectiveness of conservation tillage practices. Current methods of measuring litter cover are subjective, requiring considerable visual judgment. Reliable and objective methods are needed. The spectral reflectance (0.4-2.5 μm) of wet and dry soils (six types) and plant litters (2 crops, 14 forest, and 2 grasses) of different ages were measured. Discrimination of plant litters from the soils was ambiguous in the visible and near-infrared (0.4-1.1 μm) wavelength region. An absorption feature associated with cellulose and lignin was observed at 2.1 μm in the spectra of dry plant litter, which was not present in the spectra of soils. A new spectral variable, cellulose absorption index (CAI), was defined using the relative depth of the reflectance spectra at 2.1 μm. CAI of dry litter was significantly greater than CAI of soils. CAI generally decreased with age of the litter. Water absorption dominated the spectral properties of both soils and plant litter and significantly reduced the CAI of the plant litters. Nevertheless, the CAI of wet litter was significantly greater then CAI of wet soil. This study provides a new methodology to discriminate plant litter from soils by differences in spectral reflectance produced by their physical and chemical attributes. This remote sensing method should improve quantification of plant litter cover and thus improve estimates of phytomass production, surface energy balance, and the effectiveness of soil conservation practices. Plant litter reflectance is a verifiable component in vegetative landscapes and should be labeled and modeled separately from soils in landscape studies.

Precisely quantifying and mapping deciduousness in tropical forests will be necessary for calibrating remote sensing images which attempt to assess canopy properties such as carbon cycling, productivity, or chlorophyll content. We thus set out to assess the degree of canopy deciduousness in three moist, semi-deciduous tropical forests in central Panama. One site is a 6-ha research plot near the Atlantic coast of Panama, where rainfall is 2830 mm/yr. The second site is a 50-ha plot on Barro Colorado Island, near the center of the isthmus of Panama, where rainfall is 2570 mm/yr, and the final site is a 4-ha plot near the Pacific coast of Panama, where rainfall is 2060 mm/yr. At each site, a random sample of trees from all canopy species (those with individuals ≥30 cm DBH) were visited and scored for deciduousness three times during the 1997 dry season. The estimated peak fraction of deciduous individuals in the canopy at the wetter site was 4.8%, at the intermediate site, 6.3%, and at the drier site, 24.3%. The estimated fraction of crown area deciduous peaked at 3.6%, 9.7%, and 19.1% at the wet, medium, and dry sites respectively. The percentage of canopy species that was deciduous - 14%, 28%, and 41% - was much higher than the percentage of deciduous individuals, because not all individuals of deciduous species were deciduous.

Understanding the dynamic nature of these environments requires detailed data for wide regions regarding changes in their phyto-ecology, biomass and productivity. This article assesses the current status of satellite remote sensing in this field of application. Mapping the five main life-forms (physiognomic classes) in Mediterranean regions (forests, woodlands, scrub, dwarf shrubs and herbaceous growth) has attracted major attention in recent years. Methodologies developed for this purpose are based on the spectral, temporal and spatial (textural) information domains provided by satellite data. Wide regional vegetation mapping was achieved using phenological classification of vegetation indices derived mainly from NOAA AVHRR images. More detailed mapping was conducted with multispectral techniques in local areas using mainly Landsat TM images. Assessments of multispectral and multi-temporal categories have shown limitations in their applicability over wide regions due mainly to the heterogeneity of Mediterranean regions. This heterogeneity cannot be regarded as a simple mixing of life-forms over large areas but, rather, the formation of transitional zones of varying mixtures resulting from disturbance and recovery cycles. Productivity and biomass monitoring has been found to be an active methodological development due to the introduction of new off-nadir viewing sensors in the visible and infrared spectral bands, and because of the development of methodologies for the retrieval of biophysical information from Synthetic Aperature Radar (SAR) data. Studies of ecosystem evolution using satellite data were conducted mainly in the fields of fire disturbance and desertification. Further progress in the remote sensing of Mediterranean vegetation ecology requires a better synergy of sensors, methods and ancillary data.","Biomass; Disturbance; Landscape fragmentation; Life-forms mapping; Mediterranean vegetation; Patchiness; Remote sensing","biomass; patchiness; remote sensing; vegetation cover",,,,,,,,,,,,"Shoshany, M.; Remote Sensing and GIS Laboratory, , Ramat Gan 52900, Israel",,"Arnold",03091333,,,,"English","Prog.

Developed under the United Nations Framework Convention Climate Change (FCCC) Activities Implemented Jointly pilot phase, the project conserves natural forests that would otherwise have been subjected to continued logging and future agricultural conversion. Carbon (C) monitoring began with a C inventory of the project area in 1997. The total amount of C in the project area was 118 Tg (Tg = 1012g) ± 4% (95% confidence interval). Periodic monitoring of relevant C pools (occurring in 1999 and every 5 yr thereafter) occurs over the 30-year life of the project to establish the difference between the with-project and projected without-project scenarios. Permanent sample plots were established both inside the project area to monitor changes in C pools over time and in a proxy logging concession near the project area to determine changes in C pools in forests that have been impacted by logging. Ground-based monitoring is complemented by data collection on forest industry trends and land-use change patterns. Remote sensing was used to develop a vegetation stratification map of the area, and work is ongoing to investigate the potential application of dual-camera aerial videography to improve the efficiency of monitoring over time.","Bolivia; Carbon (C) cycle; Carbon offsets; Climate change; Emission trading; Kyoto Protocol; Land-use change and forestry","emission inventory; greenhouse gas; monitoring; Bolivia",,,,,,,,,,,,"Brown, S.; Winrock International, 1611 N.

The processing chain necessary to make such area estimations involves reconstruction of an optimal estimate of the backscattering coefficient at each pixel using temporal and spatial filtering so that classification rules derived from large scale averaging are applicable. The rationale behind the filtering strategy and the level of averaging needed is explained in terms of the observed multitemporal behavior of forest and nonforest areas. Much of this analysis is generic and applicable to a wide range of situation in which significant information is carried by multitemporal features of the data. The choice of decision rules is based on the forest observations, with the added requirement for robustness. The performance of a classifier based only on change is assessed on a range of test sites in the U.K., Finland, and Poland.

Overall, the results are somewhat pessimistic. Temporal σ° plots show chaotic variations, which are difficult to relate to the seasonal changes of forest parameters and particularly to the foliage dynamics. Furthermore, no distinction between stand types or between deciduous species is found to be possible, and nearly identical temporal plots are observed for all the stands, suggesting that the radar signatures are partly under the influence of nonforest parameters. Besides, the effect of meteorological events are difficult to evaluate. Discrimination between deciduous stands and conifers is nevertheless possible, since the radiometric difference between the two species is about 1 dB. With an overall sensitivity to standing biomass of about 0.1 dB/50 tons per hectare, ERS SAR's can be considered as almost insensitive to biomass variations. For the young stands, the C-band response is found to be dominated by stand structure, whereas the backscattering coefficient saturates for biomass values higher than 50 and 80 t DM ha-1 for deciduous and conifers, respectively.",,"Biomass; Electromagnetic wave backscattering; Forestry; Radar imaging; Satellites; Sensitivity analysis; Synthetic aperture radar; Vegetation; Environmental research satellite (ERS); Seasonal changes; Remote sensing","Centre National d’Etudes Spatiales, CNES","The authors would like to thank M.

Classification accuracy for primary forest, secondary forest, recently deforested areas, and pastures are studied to determine optimal wave parameter combinations, using an extensive database of 778 plots. Kappa statistics are used to compare results for different combinations. The relevance of polarimetry and the effect of speckle level are studied by incorporating the multilook pdf's of polarimetric phase differences and the polarimetric correlations. Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests of fit well confirm the agreement of theoretical pdf's used and experimental observations. In addition, possibilities for biomass estimation are studied using detailed vegetation structure measurements of bush-invaded grasslands (5 plots), secondary forest (10 plots), and primary forest (13 plots). Accuracy for land cover-type classification over 90% can only be obtained when two frequency bands are combined. L-band with HV polarization and P-band show the best possibilities for biomass estimation. After land cover-type classification, eight biomass classes can be differentiated at a high level of confidence.

However, the potential for these systems tO accumulate and store C and nutrients, and the fluxes resulting from them when they are cut, burned, and converted back to crop-lands and pastures have not been well quantified. In this study, we quantified pre- and post-fire pools of biomass, C, and nutrients, as well as the emissions of those elements, at a series of second- and third-growth forests located in the states of Parti and Rondonia, Brazil. Total aboveground biomass (TAGB) of second- and third-growth forests averaged 134 and 91 Mg ha-1, respectively. Rates of aboveground biomass accumulation were rapid in these systems, but were not significantly different between second- and third-growth forests, ranging from 9 to 16 Mg ha-1 year-1. Residual pools of biomass originating from primary forest vegetation accounted for large portions of TAGB in both forest types and were primarily responsible for TAGB differences between the two forest types. In second-growth forests this pool (82 Mg ha-1) represented 58% of TAGB, and in third-growth forests (40 Mg ha-1) it represented 40% of TAGB. Amounts of TAGB consumed by burning of second- and third-growth forests averaged 70 and 53 Mg ha-1, respectively. Above-ground pre-fire pools in second- and third-growth forests averaged 67 and 45 Mg C ha-1, 821 and 707 kg N ha-1, 441 and 341 kg P ha-1, and 46 and 27 kg Ca ha-1, respectively. While pre-fire pools of C, N, S and K were not significantly different between second- and third-growth forests, pools of both P and Ca were significantly higher in second-growth forests. This suggests that increasing land use has a negative impact on these elemental pools. Site losses of elements resulting from slashing and burning these sites were highly variable: losses of C ranged from 20 to 47 Mg ha-1; N losses ranged from 306 to 709 kg ha-1; Ca losses ranged from 10 to 145 kg ha-1; and P losses ranged from 2 to 20 kg ha-1. Elemental losses were controlled to a large extent by the relative distribution of elemental mass within biomass components of varying susceptibilities to combustion and the temperatures of volatilization of each element. Due to a relatively low temperature of volatilization and its concentration in highly combustible biomass pools, site losses of N averaged 70% of total pre-fire pools. In contrast, site losses of P and Ca resulting from burning were 33 and 20% of total pre-fire pools, respectively, as much of the mass of those elements was deposited on site as ash. Pre- and post-fire biomass and elemental pools of second- and third-growth forests, as well as the emissions from those systems, were intermediate between those of primary forests and pastures in the Brazilian Amazon. Overall, regenerating forests have the capacity to act as either large terrestrial sinks or sources of C and nutrients, depending on the course of land-use patterns within the Brazilian Amazon. Combining remote sensing techniques with field measures of aboveground C accumulation in regenerating forests and C fluxes from those forests when they are cut and burned, we estimate that during 1990-1991 roughly 104 Tg of C was accumulated by regenerating forests across the Brazilian Amazon. Further, we estimate that approximately 103 Tg of C was lost via the cutting and burning of regenerating forests across the Brazilian Amazon during this same period. Since average C accumulations (5.5 Mg ha-1 year-1) in regenerating forests were 19% of the C lost when such forests are cut and burned (29.3 Mg ha-1), our results suggest that when less than 19% of the total area accounted for by secondary forests is cut and burned in a given year, those forests will be net accumulators of C during that year. Conversely, when more than 19% of regenerating forests are burned, those forests will be a net source of C to the atmosphere.","Amazon Basin; Biomass burning; Carbon and nutrient pools; Regenerating forests; Tropical deforestation","biomass; carbon sequestration; fire; nutrient dynamics; regeneration; secondary forest; Amazon; Brazil; Rondonia",,,,,,,,,,,,"Hughes, R.F.; Coop.

Simulations were conducted at a 30-m spatial resolution, over a 1205 km2 portion of the BOREAS Southern Study Area of central Saskatchewan, Canada, over a 3-year period (1994-1996). Simulations of NPP for the study region were spatially and temporally complex, averaging 2.2 (± 0.6), 1.8 (± 0.5) and 1.7 (± 0.5) Mg C ha-1 year-1 for 1994, 1995 and 1996, respectively. Spatial variability of NPP was strongly controlled by the amount of aboveground biomass, particularly photosynthetic leaf area, whereas biophysical differences between broadleaf deciduous and evergreen coniferous vegetation were of secondary importance. Simulations of NPP were strongly sensitive to year-to-year variations in seasonal weather patterns, which influenced the timing of spring thaw and deciduous bud-burst. Reductions in annual NPP of approximately 17 and 22% for 1995 and 1996, respectively, were attributed to 3-and 5-week delays in spring thaw relative to 1994. Boreal forest stands with greater proportions of deciduous vegetation were more sensitive to the timing of spring thaw than evergreen coniferous stands. Similar relationships were found by comparing simulated snow depth records with 10-year records of aboveground NPP measurements obtained from biomass harvest plots within the BOREAS region. These results highlight the importance of sub-grid scale land cover complexity in controlling boreal forest regional productivity, the dynamic response of the biome to short-term interannual climate variations, and the potential implications of climate change and other large-scale disturbances.","BIOME-BGC; BOREAS; Carbon cycle; Ecosystem modeling; Net primary production; NPP; Radar; SAR",,,,,,,,,,,,,"Kimball, J.S.; Numer.

These data were taken by the SAR system (EMISAR) of the Technical University of Denmark as part of an aircraft programme sponsored by the European Space Agency. Simultaneously with these overflights, ground campaigns were conducted in 64 sample plots to measure the standing biomass density of 20 forest compartments. The microwave backscatter observed by EMISAR was found to decrease from a constant saturation value only at the very lowest biomass densities-such behaviour was expected at C and but not at L-band where a more gradual decrease was anticipated starting at medium biomass density levels. A much larger ground dataset was therefore taken from estimates of forest biomass density made by the Swedish landowners, and another microwave dataset was taken from the SAR system on board the Japanese Earth Resources Satellite (JERS-1), both of which confirmed these unexpected findings. The EMISAR results in Sweden have been compared with earlier data acquired by the SAR system (AIRSAR) of the Jet Propulsion Laboratory over the temperate plantation around Thetford in the United Kingdom. This is an area having some similarity to the Swedish sites in its biophysical characteristics but showing a quite different relationship between microwave response and biomass density. The capability of the fully polarimetric EMISAR and AIRSAR data to provide information on the dominant, scattering mechanism was employed to help investigate these contrasting results. The different behaviour of the Swedish sites may arise from the greater surface roughness or the greater moisture content of the boreal forest in this part of Scandinavia. The accuracy with which biophysical parameters can be retrieved from SAR measurements of forests depends considerably upon vegetation structure and ground conditions. The implications of these results for global inventory and for monitoring of forests using satellite microwave remote sensing are discussed briefly.","Biomass; EMISAR; Forest; JERS-1; NOPEX; SAR","atmosphere-biosphere interaction; boreal forest; comparative study; microwave imagery; research program; temperate environment; Sweden; United Kingdom","Danmarks Tekniske Universitet, DTU","This study could not have been undertaken without the full support of the NOPEX Office, particularly Sven Halldin, Magnus Erikkson and Erik Kellner, and of the NOPEX remote sensing section, particularly Adriaan van der Griend.

In many published models, Farquhar's equations were applied directly to plant canopies by assuming a plant canopy to function like a big-leaf. This big-leaf approximation is found to be acceptable for estimating seasonal trends of canopy photosynthesis but inadequate for simulating its day-to-day variations, when compared with eddy-covariance and gas-exchange chamber measurements from two boreal forests. The daily variation is greatly dampened in big-leaf simulations because the original leaf-level model is partially modified through replacing stomatal conductance with canopy conductance. Alternative approaches such as separating the canopy into sunlit and shaded leaf groups or stratifying the canopy into multiple layers can avoid the problem. Because of non-linear response of leaf photosynthesis to meteorological variables (radiation, temperature and humidity), considerable errors exist in photosynthesis calculation at daily steps without considering the diurnal variability of the variables. To avoid these non-linear effects, we have developed an analytical solution to a simplified daily integral of Farquhar's model by considering the general diurnal patterns of meteorological variables. This daily model not only captures the main effects of diurnal variations on photosynthesis but is also computationally efficient for large area applications. Its application is then not restricted by availability of sub-daily meteorological data. This scheme has been tested using measured CO2 data from the Boreal Ecosystem-Atmosphere Study (BOREAS), which took place in Manitoba and Saskatchewan in 1994 and 1996.","BOREAS; Canopy photosynthesis; CO2 flux; Farquhar model; Net primary productivity; Remote sensing application; Sunlit/shaded leaves","diurnal variation; ecological modeling; photosynthesis; remote sensing; spatial resolution; Canada; Manitoba; Saskatchewan; Boreas",,,,,,,,,,,,"Chen, J.M.; Canada Centre for Remote Sensing, 588 Booth Street, Ottawa, Ont.

Univ. Monterey Bay, Seaside, CA 93955, United States","1. A Dynamic Global Vegetation Model (DGVM) has been developed as a new feature of the NASA-CASA (Carnegie Ames Stanford Approach) ecosystem production and trace gas model. This DGVM includes seasonal phenology algorithms calibrated using historical interannual data sets derived from the Advanced Very High Resolution (AVHRR) satellite 'greenness' index. 2. The coupled CASA-DGVM design is based conceptually on two main elements of Tilman's resource-ratio hypothesis of vegetation change, namely: 1) plant competition for resources (water and light) over relatively short time periods of months and seasons; and 2) the long-term pattern in the supply of growth-limiting resources such as water and nutrients, i.e. the resource-supply trajectory. This simulation model generates global gridded estimates of primary production, above and below ground biomass, leaf area index (LAI), and trace gas fluxes from soil. 3. Eight distributed test locations for the DGVM were evaluated initially to represent a variety of climate conditions ranging from Arctic (64°N Alska) to tropical and subtropical (24°S southern Africa) latitude zones. At all test locations, the predicted plant functional type (PFT) matched closely with the actual reported PFT. 4. In the process of running the model to steady state PFTs, most forest locations showed a rapid progression of transient states, from bare ground to grassland, to grasses with shrub cover, and finally to the forest PFT. From this first global application, the DGVM correctly predicts the presence of forest classes in approximately 75-95% of all cases worldwide, and grasslands in approximately 58% of all cases. 5. The effects of two hypothetical climate change scenarios were evaluated. Scenario I was set by warming air surface temperatures linearly to 4 °C above average over a 25-year simulation period. Scenario II was set by decreasing annual rainfall amounts linearly to 50% below average over a 25-year simulation period. 6. The warming scenario I resulted in PFT at high-latitude forest and boreal forest sites changing to mixed coniferous forest, accompanied by increase in canopy LAI. The drought scenario II resulted in PFT at the boreal forest and savanna sites changing to grasslands. At locations where PFT did not change with climate, however, soil water and canopy LAI were predicted to decline progressively under the warming scenario, beginning from steady-state temperate and tropical zone PFTs. They also declined under the drought scenario beginning from practically any steady state PFT.","Biogenic trace gases; Climate change; Dynamic vegetation; Global modelling; NDVI; Net primary production; Plant biomass; Remote sensing","biomass; climate change; computer simulation; flux measurement; leaf area index; primary production; trace gas; vegetation classification; vegetation dynamics",,,,,,,,,,,,"Klooster, S.A.; California State University, Monterey Bay, Seaside, CA 93955, United States; email: sklooster@mail.arc.nasa.gov",,,1466822X,,GEBIF,,"English","Global Ecol.

Degradation of forest-cover is often a complex process, with some degree of ecological reversibility and a strong interaction with climatic fluctuations. Only a representation of land cover as a continuous field of several biophysical variables can lead to an accurate detection of forest degradation. For this purpose, repetitive measurements of spectral, spatial and temporal indicators of the land surface have to be performed. Each set of indicators brings a specific type of information on the land cover. These indicators must therefore be combined to achieve a comprehensive description of the surface processes. The detection of inter-annual changes in landscape spatial structure is more likely to reveal long term and long lasting land-cover changes, while spectral indicators are more sensitive to fluctuations in primary productivity associated with climatic fluctuations. Different monitoring systems may be optimal for different ecosystems. A long time series of observations is always required. The monitoring of the spatio-temporal distribution of biomass burning may also give indications of open forest degradation.","Africa; Deforestation; Forest degradation; Land-cover change; Landscape; Monitoring; Remote sensing; Tropical forest","deforestation; degradation; environmental monitoring; landscape change; methodology; remote sensing; tropical forest; Africa",,,,,,,,,,,,"Lambin, E.F.; Department of Geography, place Louis Pasteur, B-1348 Louvain-la-Neuve, Belgium; email: lambin@geog.ucl.ac.be",,,1466822X,,GEBIF,,"English","Global Ecol.

Unlike conventional microwave and optical sensors, lidar sensors directly measure the distribution of vegetation material along the vertical axis and can be used to provide three-dimensional, or volumetric, characterizations of vegetation structure. Ecological applications of scanning lidar have hitherto used one-dimensional indices to characterize canopy height. A novel three-dimensional analysis of lidar waveforms was developed to characterize the total volume and spatial organization of vegetation material and empty space within the forest canopy. These aspects of the physical structure of canopies have been infrequently measured, from either field or remote methods. We applied this analysis to 22 plots in Douglas-fir/western hemlock stands on the west slope of the Cascades Range in Oregon. Each plot had coincident lidar data and field measurements of stand structure. We compared results from the novel analysis to two earlier methods of canopy description. Using the indices of canopy structure from all three methods of description as independent variables in a stepwise multiple regression, we were able to make nonasymptotic predictions of biomass and leaf area index (LAI) over a wide range, up to 1200 Mg ha-1 of biomass and an LAI of 12, with 90% and 75% of variance explained, respectively. Furthermore, we were able to make accurate estimates of other stand structure attributes, including the mean and standard deviation of diameter at breast height, the number of stems greater than 100 cm in diameter, and independent estimates of the basal area of Douglas-fir and western hemlock. These measurements can be directly related to indices of forest stand structural complexity, such as those developed for old-growth forest characterization. Indices of canopy structure developed using the novel, three-dimensional analysis accounted for most of the variables used in predictive equations generated by the stepwise multiple regression.A novel 3D analysis of lidar waveforms was developed to characterized the total volume and spatial organization of vegetation material and empty space within the forest canopy.

The seasonal and weather dependent parameters considered include the depth of soil frost topsoil moisture snow water equivalent air temperature and precipitation. The effect of these parameters on a° are studied for various stem volume (biomass) classes by comparing the results against a cloud model-based semi-empirical modeling approach. Semi-empirical modeling is also used for a forest biomass retrieval experiment. The SAR data set includes 4 JERS-1 (L-band HH-polarization) and 19 ERS-1 (C-band VV-polarization) images for a test area in southern Finland. Additionally a set of 2 JERS-1 and 3 ERS1 images for another test area in northern Finland is employed. The results show that radar response to forest biomass is more sensitive to changes in temporally varying parameters at C-band than at L-band. The semi-empirical modeling approach describes well the behavior of a° at both frequency bands when large forest areas are considered. Moreover the modeling approach appears to be applicable for different conifer-dominated boreal forest types. Since the modeling approach explains satisfactorily the average backscattering behavior the results in biomass retrieval show high accuracies (25-30% relative RMSE) when areas under investigation are large enough i.e. about 20 ha. © 1999 IEEE.","Backscattering modeling; Remote sensing of forests","Bandwidth; Biomass; Electromagnetic wave backscattering; Forestry; Synthetic aperture radar; Boreal forests; Remote sensing",,,,,,,,,,,,"Pulliainen, J.T.; Laboratory of Space Technology, , 02150 Espoo, Finland",,,01962892,,IGRSD,,"English","IEEE Trans Geosci Remote Sens",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0033099198

The multitemporal ERS-1 data indicate that primary forest areas display a very stable radar backscattering coefficient (a°), while in some cases, disturbed areas (nonforest and regenerating forest) exhibit changes that appear to be associated with soil moisture variations. To counteract a° distortions caused by topography, change detection based on ratios of intensity images (or differences of log images) provides a more useful discrimination approach than a° variations in single images. Change detection techniques are compared, and their ability to classify primary and disturbed forest is quantitatively assessed, assuming that a land cover map inferred from a 1992 Landsat thematic mapper (TM) image is correct. Even in the best case, less than 50% of the disturbed forest region is detected in the ERS-1 images. This figure may be improved by more frequent image acquisition, but there are fundamental limitations in using C-band data since the effects of soil moisture changes on a° are masked once even comparatively low levels of standing biomass are present. At the longer wavelength of JERS-1, much better discrimination is possible, but the correction of topographic distortions is likely to present problems. © 1999 IEEE.","Backscatter modeling; Change detection; Classification; Image filtering; Segmentation","Biomass; Electromagnetic wave backscattering; Forestry; Image segmentation; Mathematical models; Moisture; Radar imaging; Signal detection; Signal filtering and prediction; Synthetic aperture radar; Tropics; Vegetation; Change detection method; Thematic mappers (TM); Remote sensing","National Eye Research Centre, NERC: ST/92/EOB/3; European Commission, EC","Manuscript received March 25, 1997; revised March 16, 1998.

AIRSAR data at P-, L-, and C-band were acquired over French Guiana in June 1993. Structural parameters, namely, tree height, tree diameter at breast height (DBH), tree density, basal area, and total aboveground biomass were estimated in 12 stands representative of different mangrove forest stages. At the study site, total biomass ranges from about 5 to 437 tons of dry matter per ha (t DM ha-1). Strong relationships were found between most forest parameters and radar data, with P-HV showing the greatest sensitivity to total biomass. Estimation of the forest parameters was performed through multiple stepwise regression techniques. While a"" at P-HV saturated at about 160 t DM ha""1, the use of several frequencies and polarizations allowed total biomass to be accurately estimated up to about 240 t DM ha-1. Furthermore, the use of polarization ratios at different frequencies has provided useful information about the penetration capability of the radar wave as well as the dominant mechanisms occurring between the radar wave and the mangrove canopy. © 1999 IEEE.","AIRSAR; Biomass; Forestry; Mangrove; Radar scattering; Vegetation","Biomass; Electromagnetic wave backscattering; Electromagnetic wave polarization; Forestry; Parameter estimation; Radar imaging; Regression analysis; Sensitivity analysis; Synthetic aperture radar; Vegetation; Mangrove forests; Multifrequency/multipolarization synthetic aperture radars; Remote sensing","Centre National d’Etudes Spatiales, CNES","Manuscript received January 29, 1997; revised September 27, 1997.

The stem volume map was produced from the National Forest Inventory sample plot data together with a LANDSAT thematic mapper (TM) image. A new indirect inversion method was developed and tested to estimate the forest blockwise stem volume from JERS-1 and/or ERS-1 SAR images. The method is based on using a semiempirical backscatter model for inversion. The model presumes that backscatter from a forest canopy is determined by the stem volume, soil moisture, and vegetation moisture. The area of interest is divided into a training and test area. In this study, the training area was 10% of the test site, while the remaining 90% was used for testing the method. The inversion algorithm is carried out in the following three steps. 1) For the training area, the soil and vegetation moisture parameters are estimated from the backscattering coefficients and stem volume (must be known for training areas) with the semiempirical backscatter model. 2) For the area of interest, the stem volume is estimated from the moisture parameters and backscattering coefficients with the semiempirical backscattering model. 3) If several SAR images are used, the stem volume estimates are combined with a multiple linear regression. The regression equation is defined using the stem volume estimates for the training area. The results for the stem volume estimation using L-band and/or C-band SAR data showed promising accuracies: the relative retrieval rms error varied from 30 to 5 % as the size of the forest area varied from 5 to 30000 ha (the forest stem volume varied from 0 to 300 m3/ha). © 1999 IEEE.","Backscattering properties of boreal forests; Ers-1 synthetic aperture radar (sar); Forest biomass estimation; JERS-1 SAR","Algorithms; Biomass; Data reduction; Electromagnetic wave backscattering; Forestry; Image analysis; Inverse problems; Moisture; Parameter estimation; Radar imaging; Synthetic aperture radar; Vegetation; Inversion algorithms; Semiempirical backscatter models; Thematic mapper images; Remote sensing","European Commission, EC","Manuscript received June 30, 1997; revised February 10, 1998.

Simulations were conducted over a 3 year period (1994-1996) at spatial scales ranging from 30 to 50 km within the BOREAS southern modeling subarea. Simulated fluxes were spatially complex, ranging from 0.1 to 3.9 Mg C ha-1 yr-1 and from 18 to 29 cm yr-1. Biomass and leaf area index heterogeneity predominantly controlled this complexity, while biophysical differences between deciduous and coniferous vegetation were of secondary importance. Spatial aggregation of land cover characteristics resulted in mean monthly NPP estimation bias from 25 to 48% (0.11-0.20 g C m-2 d-1) and annual estimation errors from 2 to 14% (0.04-0.31 Mg C ha-1 yr-1). Error was reduced at longer time intervals because coarse scale overestimation errors during spring were partially offset by underestimation of fine scale results during summer and winter. ET was relatively insensitive to land cover spatial scale with an average bias of less than 5% (0.04 kg m-2 d-1). Factors responsible for differences in scaling behavior between ET and NPP included compensating errors for ET calculations and boreal forest spatial and temporal NPP complexity. Careful consideration of landscape spatial and temporal heterogeneity is necessary to identify and mitigate potential error sources when using plot scale information to understand regional scale patterns. Remote sensing data integrated within an ecological process model framework provides an efficient mechanism to evaluate scaling behavior, interpret patterns in coarse resolution data, and identify appropriate scales of operation for various processes.

The PEM was based on carbon yields of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation for both gross and net primary production (GPP and NPP), accounting for environmental stress and autotrophic respiration (Ra). Physiological control was modeled using remotely sensed maps of air temperature, vapor pressure deficit, and soil moisture. The accuracy of the inferred variables was generally within 10-30% of point measurements at the surface and independent model results (both at the stand level). Biomass maps were derived from visible reflectance measurements and were also compared to independently derived maps. Area-averaged GPP was 604 g C m-2 yr-1 compared with average canopy respiration of 428 g C m-2 yr-1 and NPP of 235 g C m-2 yr-1. Net annual carbon uptake in net primary production for the region totaled 175 teragrams. Canopy carbon exchange (GPP and Ra) differed widely between land cover types even though the model does not use land cover information. Extensive areas of the least productive cover types (e.g., lowland needleleaf species) accounted for the greatest amount of NPP.

During the last 20 years considerable research efforts have been devoted to the extraction of land cover information from these data. Only during the last few years have these methods begun to be applied in operational contexts. Such applications have thus far primarily addressed key global change issues such as the global carbon balance. Examples of the successful quasi-operational implementation of remote sensing include NASA's Humid Tropical Landsat Pathfinder project, where high resolution data are being used at subcontinental scales to measure change in the areal extent of tropical rain forests throughout the world, and the Tropical Ecosystem Environment observation by Satellite (TREES) project to assess forest cover in the tropics. At coarser resolutions, a number of land cover products suitable for incorporation in global and regional models have been developed. Alternatives to traditional land cover classifications have also been developed to describe gradients and mosaics in the vegetation more realistically. These land cover products offer the possibility for applications in ecological and human dimensions research at regional and global scales, as well as for implementation of international agreements that require land cover information. Recently launched and future satellites will carry sensors that provide data with greatly improved capabilities for land cover characterization and advancements in computing environments make it feasible to take advantage of these new data. However, several challenges must be overcome in making a transition from research to operational land cover monitoring, including automation of methods to analyse the satellite data, more effective techniques for validation, and assurance of long-term continuity in the availability of satellite measurements.","Global vegetation; Land cover; Operational monitoring; Remote sensing; Satellite data; Tropical deforestation","global change; land cover; remote sensing; research and development; satellite data",,,,,,,,,,,,"Defries, R.S.; Department of Geography, , College Park, MD 20742, United States",,,1466822X,,GEBIF,,"English","Global Ecol.

In this paper, we investigated the response of net CO2 exchange in terrestrial ecosystems to interannual climate variability (1983 to 1988) using global satellite observations as drivers for the NASA-CASA (Carnegie-Ames-Stanford Approach) simulation model. This computer model of net ecosystem production (NEP) is calibrated for interannual simulations driven by monthly satellite vegetation index data (NDVI) from the NOAA Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) at 1 degree spatial resolution. Major results from NASA-CASA simulations suggest that from 1985 to 1988, the northern middle-latitude zone (between 30 and 60°N) was the principal region driving progressive annual increases in global net primary production (NPP; i.e., the terrestrial biosphere sink for carbon). The average annual increase in NPP over this predominantly northern forest zone was on the order of +0.4 Pg (1015 g) C per year. This increase resulted mainly from notable expansion of the growing season for plant carbon fixation toward the zonal latitude extremes, a pattern uniquely demonstrated in our regional visualization results. A net biosphere source flux of CO2 in 1983-1984, coinciding with an El Nino event, was followed by a major recovery of global NEP in 1985 which lasted through 1987 as a net carbon sink of between 0.4 and 2.6 Pg C per year. Analysis of model controls on NPP and soil heterotrophic CO2 fluxes (R(h)) suggests that regional warming in northern forests can enhance ecosystem production significantly. In seasonally dry tropical zones, periodic drought and temperature drying effects may carry over with at least a two-year lag time to adversely impact ecosystem production. These yearly patterns in our model-predicted NEP are consistent in magnitude with the estimated exchange of CO2 by the terrestrial biosphere with the atmosphere, as determined by previous isotopic (δ13C) deconvolution analysis. Ecosystem simulation results can help further target locations where net carbon sink fluxes have occurred in the past or may be verified in subsequent field studies.",,"biogeochemistry; carbon dioxide; carbon sink; remote sensing","National Aeronautics and Space Administration, NASA","The authors thank J.

The boreal landscape is heterogeneous owing to different forest cover types and disturbance regimes, and regional quantification of CO2 flux is difficult without numerous species-specific flux measurements. During the Boreal Ecosystem-Atmosphere Study in 1994 and 1996 the National Research Council of Canada operated a Twin Otter aircraft that measured CO2, sensible and latent heat fluxes, and other trace gases over boreal forests in Saskatchewan, Canada. A flux-unmixing method was developed to calculate flux densities for eight major cover types from the aircraft-based measurements. Using a coregistered land cover map at 30-m resolution derived from Landsat thematic mapper data, the contribution of each cover type to the CO2 flux measured by the aircraft was estimated using a contributing area (footprint) function according to the wind direction, the atmospheric stability, the horizontal distance of each pixel from the aircraft, and aircraft height. The unmixing method uses a linear inversion method with the footprint-weighted cover type fractions as the set coefficients for each segment of a flight line. In the inversion, various constraint strategies were used to confine the inversion results to minimize the effect of various sampling errors. It is shown that (1) mathematical constraint is critically important in the inversion, (2) a simple constraint toward the mean flux values is effective in producing reasonable inversion results, and (3) the inversion accuracy can be further improved when simultaneous tower measurements in the dominant cover types are used as tight constraints. With such constraints the estimated fluxes from the cover types without tower measurements appear to be reasonable. It is concluded that aircraft measurement adds to our ability to map the regional flux field using remote sensing images because (1) it allows the derivation of flux data for cover types without tower-based measurements and (2) it can be used to infer the representativeness of tower measurements for the measured cover types in the landscape.

However, the implicit predictive models are qualitative, complex and rarely communicated in a clear manner. The possibility of developing an explicit analogue of conventional survey practice suited to medium to low intensity surveys is considered. A key feature is the use of quantitative environmental variables from digital terrain analysis and airborne gamma radiometric remote sensing to predict the spatial distribution of soil properties. The use of these technologies for quantitative soil survey is illustrated using an example from the Bago and Maragle State Forests in southeastern Australia. A design-based, stratified, two-stage sampling scheme was adopted for the 50,000 ha area using digital geology, landform and climate as stratifying variables. The landform and climate variables were generated using a high resolution digital elevation model with a grid size of 25 m. Site and soil data were obtained from 165 sites. Regression trees and generalised linear models were then used to generate spatial predictions of soil properties using digital terrain and gamma radiometric survey data as explanatory variables. The resulting environmental correlation models generate spatial predictions with a fine grain unmatched by comparable conventional survey methods. Example models and spatial predictions are presented for soil profile depth, total phosphorus and total carbon. The models account for 42%, 78% and 54% of the variance present in the sample respectively. The role of spatial dependence, issues of scale and landscape complexity are discussed along with the capture of expert knowledge. It is suggested that environmental correlation models may form a useful trend model for various forms of kriging if spatial dependence is evident in the residuals of the model.","Classification and regression trees; Digital elevation model; Digital terrain model; Soil carbon; Soil depth; Soil sampling; Soil survey; Spatial prediction; Total phosphorus","prediction; soil property; soil survey; spatial analysis; Australia",,,,,,,,,,,,"McKenzie, N.J.; CSIRO Land and Water, GPO Box 1666, Canberra, ACT 2601, Australia; email: neil.mckenzie@cbr.clw.csiro.au",,,00167061,,GEDMA,,"English","Geoderma",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032895729

However, traditional methods such as NDVI for deriving these variables from remotely sensed data have been inconsistent and unsatisfactory due to factors such as the confounding influence of background reflectance and canopy geometry on the overall pixel signal. To address this problem, we present new results which use spectral mixture analysis to determine areal fractions of sunlit canopy, sunlit background, and shadow at subpixel scales for predicting these biophysical variables. Geometric-optical reflectance models are used to estimate sunlit canopy component reflectance for input to the analysis together with field measures of background and shadow reflectance. In this article, we compare cylinder, cone, and spheroid models of canopy geometry and evaluate the importance of solar zenith angle variations in reflectance estimates for mixture fractions. These are computed from helicopter MMR radiometer data for 31 stands of black spruce along a gradient of stand densities near the southern fringe of the North American boreal forest. Component fractions are evaluated against ground data derived from dense-grid point analyses of coincident high resolution color photography and also for predicting biophysical variables. In general, the Li-Strahler spheroid model was better than the cone and cylinder models and the importance of correcting for solar zenith angle (SZA) was illustrated, with significant improvements noted for higher SZA as a result of corrections for canopy mutual shadowing. The best overall results were obtained from the shadow fraction using a spheroid model of canopy geometry at SZA 45°. Linear regression analyses showed biomass could he estimated with r2 values of 0.83 and a standard error (S.E.) of 1.7 kg/m2; LAI: r2=0.82, S.E.=0.46; and NPP: r2=0.86, S.E.=O. 05 kg/m2/yr. These results were significantly higher than with NDVI for estimating biomass (r2=0.44), LAI (r2=0.60), and NPP (r2=0.56). Current and future areas of research are outlined towards improving our understanding of carbon cycling in large forested ecosystems as a function of variability in the physical climate system and environmental change.Biophysical structural information such as biomass, LAI, and NPP are important inputs to regional scale models of ecosystem processes and photosynthetic activity within boreal forests. However, traditional methods such as NDVI for deriving these variables from remotely sensed data have been inconsistent and unsatisfactory due to factors such as the confounding influence of background reflectance and canopy geometry on the overall pixel signal. To address this problem, we present new results which use spectral mixture analysis to determine areal fractions of sunlit canopy, sunlit background, and shadow at subpixel scales for predicting these biophysical variables. Geometric-optical reflectance models are used to estimate sunlit canopy component reflectance for input to the analysis together with field measures of background and shadow reflectance. In this article, we compare cylinder, cone, and spheroid models of canopy geometry and evaluate the importance of solar zenith angle variations in reflectance estimates for mixture fractions. These are computed from helicopter MMR radiometer data for 31 stands of black spruce along a gradient of stand densities near the southern fringe of the North American boreal forest. Component fractions are evaluated against ground data derived from dense-grid point analyses of coincident high resolution color photography and also for predicting biophysical variables.

It is of particular interest that the study area covers the transition zone between the savanna and the forest domains. Satellite remote sensing is the only technology that allows: consistent data collection of the spatial and temporal distribution of fires at the scale required by the EXPRESSO experiment. A portable monitoring system was developed and operated in Central Africa for the in situ, real-time acquisition and processing of National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration-advanced very high resolution radiometer (AVHRR) imagery during the EXPRESSO dry season field campaign, which lasted from October 1, 1996, to December 2, 1996. One AVHRR scene per day was processed to locate active fires and burnt areas. These results are compared with our daily global maps of vegetation fires derived from the International Geosphere-Biosphere Programme-Data and Information System Global AVHRR data set for the period April 1992 to December 1993. This comparison shows the EXPRESSO fires in the context of the African continent and of the total global fire activity. The EXPRESSO study area is part of one of the largest fire belts observed in Africa, and even over the globe, spreading from Senegal to Ethiopia. This study also shows a big increase in the number of fires in 1996 compared to 1993, from a total of 39,500 fire pixels detected in November 1993 to 124,500 in November 1996. We also show that the November period corresponds to a minimum of the global fire activity: only 3% of the fires detected during a complete year were detected during this month. Moreover, the number of fires detected in this particular month was 28% of those detected during the annual peak period observed in July-August. Current activity is focusing on the implementation of the World-Fire-Web network: A system for globally mapping vegetation fires.

This study considered the potential use of MIR reflectance for studying tropical forests, with the relationship between MIR reflectance and estimated total biomass of the tropical forests of Cameroon derived. Comparisons were drawn with relationships between estimated total biomass and visible reflectance, near infrared reflectance, MIR radiation and surface temperature. Relationships between two vegetation indices, the NDVI and VI3, and estimated total biomass were also explored. It was found that correcting MIR radiation for thermal emission increased the strength of the relationship between radiation acquired in MIR wavelengths and estimated total biomass. The use of MIR reflectance, either alone or within the vegetation index VI3, provided the strongest relationship with estimated total biomass. This suggests that MIR reflectance may be more sensitive to changes in forest properties than the reflectance in visible and NIR wavelengths. It is recommended that MIR reflectance should be adopted more widely for the remote sensing of tropical forests. © 1999 Taylor & Francis Ltd.",,"Biomass; Infrared radiation; Light reflection; Vegetation; Middle infrared radiation (MIR); Thermal emission; Remote sensing; biomass; reflectance; solar radiation; tropical forest; Cameroon",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,01431161,,,,"English","Int.

Using SPOT HRV (High Resolution Visible) data, techniques were developed and tested to discriminate primary forest, secondary forest and deforested areas on a study site in Rondonia, Brazil. Six co-registered SPOT HRV images (1986, 1988, 1989, 1991, 1992 and 1994) were used to create a time series of classified images of land cover (primary forest, secondary forest and deforested). These trajectories were used to identify secondary forest age classes relative to the most recent (1994) image. The resultant 1994 map of primary forest, secondary forest age classes and deforested areas served as ground reference data to establish training and testing sites. Several band 2 and 3 texture measurements were calculated using a 3 x 3 window to quantify canopy homogeneity. Neural networks and linear analysis techniques were tested for discriminating between primary forest, secondary forest and deforested pixels. The techniques were also employed to extract secondary forest age. A neural network using band 3 and a texture measure of band 2 and 3 from a single image (1994) discriminated primary forest, secondary forest (1 to >9 years) and deforested pixel with an average accuracy of 95%. The use of texture information increased the secondary forest discrimination accuracy 6.4% (from 83.5 to 89.9%). Spectral and textural information were also used to predict secondary forest age as a continuous variable. The neural network with the highest accuracy produced a RMSE (predicted network age versus actual secondary forest age) of 2.0 years with a coefficient of determination (predicted versus true) of 0.38. These results were significantly improved by using multitemporal information. The spectral and textural information from two images (1994 and 1989) were used to extract secondary forest information. The neural network results showed that 95.5% of the secondary forest pixels were correctly classified as secondary forest pixels (as opposed to 89.9% of the pixels using only the 1994 image). The RMSE and R2 accuracies in extracting secondary forest age as a continuous variable were 1.3 and 0.75, respectively. © 1999 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,"Forestry; Neural networks; Pattern recognition; Photomapping; Satellites; Time series analysis; Canopy homogeneity; High resolution visible data; Linear analysis techniques; Satellite positioning and tracking; Texture measurements; Remote sensing; age; secondary forest; SPOT; vegetation mapping",,"This work was funded by the Ecological Process and Modeling Program, Oce of Mission to Planet Earth, NASA Headquarters.",,,,,,,,,,"Kimes, D.S.; NASA/Goddard Space Flight Center, , Greenbelt, MD, 20771, United States",,,01431161,,,,"English","Int.

From an inventory and monitoring operational point of view, such an approach implies wise use of geographic information systems and remote sensing techniques enabling a global view of the territorial mosaic. From a methodological point of view, landscape ecology theory may be used as the assessment framework. Remotely sensed data provide excellent opportunities for the involved analyses, using both vegetation density measures and spatial statistics. The objective of this paper was to assess landscape spatial heterogeneity using an analysis method based on Shannon's information theoretic entropy applied to satellite remotely sensed inputs of plant biomass. A forested mountainous landscape of Central Italy was examined as a case study. In this area, anthropogenic disturbance resulted as opposing the natural tendency of vegetation towards an horizontally homogeneous landscape giving way to a micro-heterogeneous structure composed of long-term stratification of small patches. The proposed analysis method proves to be simply refinable by more finely classifying land cover types to enable a more thoroughly landscape texture properties linkage to ecological processes. © 1999 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

Coincident estimates of the vertical distribution, of canopy surface area (the canopy height profile), and field-measured stand structure attributes were acquired for two data sets. The chronosequence data set consists of 48 plots in stands distributed within 25 miles of Annapolis, MD, with canopy height profiles measured in the field using the optical-quadrat method. The stem-map data set consists of 75 plots subsetted from a single 32 ha stem-mapped stand, with measurements of their canopy height profiles made using the SLICER (Scanning Lidar hanger of Canopies by Echo Recovery) instrument, an airborne surface lidar system. Four height indices, maximum, median, mean, and quadratic mean canopy height (QMCH) were calculated from the canopy height profiles. Regressions between the indices and stand basal area and biomass were developed using the chronosequence data set. The regression equations developed from the chronosequence data set were then applied to height indices calculated from the remotely sensed canopy height profiles from the stem map data set, and the ability of the regression equations to predict the stem map plot's stand structure attributes was then evaluated. The QMCH was found to explain the most variance in the chronosequence data set's stand structure attributes, and to most accurately predict the values of the same attributes in the stem map data set. For the chronosequence data set, the QMCH predicted 70% of variance in stand basal area, and 80% of variance in aboveground biomass, and remained nonasymptotic with basal areas up to 50 m2 ha-1, and aboveground biomass values up to 450 Mg ha-1. When applied to the stem-map data set, the regression equations resulted in basal areas that were, on average, underestimated by 2.1 m2 ha-1, and biomass values were underestimated by 16 Mg ha-1, and explained 37% and 33% of variance, respectively. Differences in the magnitude of the coefficients of determination were due to the wider range of stand conditions found in the chronosequence data set; the standard deviation of residual values were lower in the stem map data set than on the chronosequence data sets. Stepwise multiple regression was performed to predict the two stand structure attributes using the canopy height profile data directly as independent variables, but they did not improve the accuracy of the estimates over the height index approach.A method of predicting two forest stand structure attributes, basal area and aboveground biomass was developed and tested using field and remotely sensed canopy structure measurements. Coincident estimates of the vertical distribution of canopy surface area, and field-measured stand structure attributes were acquired for two data sets: the chronosequence data set and stem-map data set. Four height indices, maximum, median, mean, and quadratic mean canopy height (QMCH) were calculated from the canopy height profiles. Regressions between the indices and stand basal area and biomass were developed using the chronosequence data set. The developed regression equations were also applied to the stem-map data set. Stepwise multiple regression did not improve the accuracy of the estimates over the height index approach.",,"Biomass; Data acquisition; Forestry; Optical radar; Regression analysis; Airborne surface lidar system; Chronosequence data set; Quadratic mean canopy height; Remote sensing; biomass; canopy architecture; deciduous forest; lidar; remote sensing; stand structure; United States","National Aeronautics and Space Administration, NASA; University of Virginia, UV","This work was performed at the University of Virginia and at NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center, and was supported by the Terrestrial Ecology Program of NASA’s Mission to Planet Earth, the NASA University Program, and the Smithsonian Environmental Sciences Program.

Environmental factors such as ice characteristics, water depth, bottom type affect the distribution and biomass of macrophytes in the study area. Image analysis was applied to the area where the water depth varies from 0 to 6 m; these are depths at which kelp and bare substrate can be differentiated with HRV imaging. The prediction model showed that most of the study area favors large biomass concentrations. The multidate analysis of the HRV and TM images confirmed this information.

The characteristics of each type are discussed and illustrated by reference to some of the more important of the models in current use. The emphasis in this paper is on the carbon balance models, particularly on a new model (3-PG), developed in a deliberate attempt to bridge the gap between growth and yield and carbon balance models, and the companion model (3-PGS) derived from 3-PG to utilize satellite data as inputs to constrain the simulation calculations and improve estimates of growth over time. 3-PG/3-PGS run on monthly time steps, driven by weather data, and avoid the problems of over-parameterization and the requirements for a great deal of input data that limit the practical value of most carbon balance models. We present test results from 3-PG against experimental data, and against forest plot (mensuration) data from large areas; also test results from 3-PGS against estimates of average forest growth over large areas, and in plantations with different planting times, using AVHRR and Landsat MSS data to constrain the model outputs.

The Li-Strahler geometric optical mutual shadowing (GOMS) forest reflectance model provides a physical basis for defining forest class inputs to a supervised classification algorithm, and serves a similar purpose as training data in a conventional classifier. This model also computes sub-pixel scale mixture fractions (%canopy, %background, %shadow), which have been shown in other studies to provide improved estimates of biophysical variables such as LAI and biomass. This model has been coupled with an evidential reasoning classification algorithm, which was chosen for its ability to process a greater diversity of data types (e.g., remote sensing imagery, thematic GIS data, topographic variables), and because it provides classification results with higher accuracy and efficiency compared to other algorithms such as maximum likelihood and neural networks. The interface developed between the reflectance model and the evidential classifier is the focus of this paper. Two issues in modifying the evidential reasoning algorithm for achieving reflectance model integration are presented and evaluated: (i) the variability of canopy reflectance model inputs to the classifier, and (ii) the method of converting these model inputs into suitable forms of evidence for use in the evidential reasoning classifier. Three approaches to model integration were tested in a BOREAS forestry application. of these, a frequency-based transformation method applied to the modelled reflectance inputs produced the highest overall landcover classification accuracy of 84%, which was a 30% increase over the other methods tested. © 1999 Canadian Journal of Remote Sensing/Journal canadien de télédétection.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Peddle, D.R.; Department of Geography, , Lethbridge, AB, T1K 3M4, Canada",,,07038992,,,,"English","Can J Remote Sens",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0000311726

Boreal forests play an important, but not well known, role in the global hydrological and biogeochemical cycles. NOPEX (a NOrthern hemisphere climate Processes land surface EXperiment) is devoted to the study of land surface-atmosphere interaction in a northern European forest-dominated landscape. The main NOPEX region represents the southern edge of the boreal zone. It consists of a highly heterogeneous landscape, with forests, mires, agricultural land and lakes. A second study site, in northern Finland, representing the northern edge of the boreal zone, will be introduced into NOPEX in connection with its coming winter-time field activities. Field activities, dominating the initial phase of NOPEX, are conceived to strike a balance between the need to cover multi-annual observations and the resources required to carry out measurements covering all relevant spatial scales. The long-term data collection activities, the Continuous Climate Monitoring (CCM), form the backbone of the field programme. A suite of Concentrated Field Efforts (CFEs) covering periods of summer, spring and winter brings together scientists from more than 20 countries during month-long campaigns. CFEs have been carded out in May-June 1994 and April-July 1995. A third, winter-time CFE is planned for 1998-99. The System for Information in NOPEX (SINOP) is the database which forms a backbone for modelling and analysis work, dominating the second stage of NOPEX. A series of PhD courses are run in parallell to the research activities. Analysis and modelling are done in four interacting areas, including local-scale processes, meso-scale surface-atmosphere coupling and remote sensing techniques. The fourth area, regionalization methods, aims at bringing- the previous three together in order to provide improved parameterization schemes for exchange of energy, momentum, water and CO2 between land and atmosphere in hydrological and meteorological models from the meso to the global scale.The NOrthern hemisphere climate Processes land surface EXperiment (NOPEX) is devoted to the study of land surface-atmosphere interaction in a northern European forest-dominated landscape.

Understanding how forest backscatter varies over the range of probable surface conditions is important in the selection of appropriate radar bands and incidence angles for forest sensing applications and for quantifying uncertainty of the derived forest characteristics. Using a canopy backscatter model, we examined the sensitivity of modeled C- and L-band backscatter to five surface parameters in three loblolly pine stands representing different stages of development in Duke Forest (NC). The parameters were litter depth and moisture content, soil rms height and correlation length, and soil moisture content. Of the bands considered, L-HH backscatter had the highest sensitivity to the surface parameters, followed by L-VV. In the incidence angle range of 20°-40°, L-HH varied by 5.3-9.6 dB as the surface parameters changed over their range, whereas L-VV varied by 3.7-4.5 dB. At shallower incidence angles, the sensitivities were lower but probably not negligible. C-HH and C-VV were sensitive only at steep incidence (θ0=20°-30°) for the lowest biomass stand studied. C-HH and C-W sensitivity fell off with increasing incidence angle and stand maturity. L-HV showed slight sensitivity for the low-biomass stand and at θ0=20°-30°but was otherwise insensitive. C-HV was insensitive to the surface for all stands and angles. At L-hand, the most influential of the five parameters was soil rms height, whereas, at C-band, all parameters were about equal in influence. The modeled sensitivities suggested that the surface-related uncertainty in forest backscatter at L-HH and L-VV, and at C-HH and C-VV at steep incidence angles, may be unacceptably large for many applications.The sensitivity of modeled C- and L-band backscatter to five surface parameters in three loblolly pine stands was examined using a canopy backscatter model.

We based our analysis on a new methodology called Hierarchical Foreground and Background Analysis (HFBA) that derives sequentially a series of weighting vectors which simultaneously extract important discriminant features, in this case, leaf anatomy and chemical concentration at different levels of detection from the spectral information. In this study, we focused on the application of detecting carbon, cellulose, nitrogen concentrations, and water content. The goal of the derived vectors is twofold: 1) create a robust detection and classification system of constituent materials and 2) create a good information packing system that minimizes extraneous undesired interference, like noise, in the analysis. In our study, two data sets were examined: a fresh leaf (FL) data set, LOPEx [from the Joint Research Center (JRC), Ispra, Italy], and a dry leaf data set, Blackhawk Island (BH), WI [University of New Hampshire (UNH), Durham]. We tested the robustness of the derived vectors with four other data sets: fresh leaf data from Jasper Ridge Biological Preserve (JRBP) (chemistry from UNH, spectra from University of California, Davis), Santa Monica Mountains (SMM), CA, [from University of California, Davis (UCDavis)], and dry leaf data from two ACCP sites (UNH): Howland (HO), ME, and Harvard Forest (HF), MA. The results support the robustness of the HFBA system and demonstrate an advantage in classification accuracy (first level) as well as in predicting the biochemical composition (subsequent levels) over classical forms of analysis that ignore effects of the nonlinear variation that contribute to reflectance at different (subpixel and spectral) scales. HFBA primarily deals with the spectral scaling issue. © 1998 IEEE.","Leaf biochemistry spectral characteristics; Spectral feature extraction; Vegetation mapping","Biochemistry; Feature extraction; Mapping; Spectrum analysis; Vectors; Vegetation; Hierarchical foreground/background analysis (HFBA); Leaf biochemistry spectral characteristics; Remote sensing","National Aeronautics and Space Administration, NASA: NAGW-4626-I, NAS5-31 359, NAS5-31 714, NAS7-918; Fundación para el futuro de Colombia, COLFUTURO","Manuscript received April 22, 1996; revised May 6, 1997.

Past studies, mostly empirical, already showed the potential of remote sensing for investigating these aspects. However, till now modeling approaches were mostly limited by the absence of physical models able to simulate both remote sensing images and the 3-D within stand radiation in heterogeneous covers. This paper builds upon a new radiative transfer model (Discrete Anisotropic Radiative Transfer (DART)) that provides this information. The modeling study was applied to a tropical rain forest site in central Sumatra. Intensive field work led to detailed structural data on a 1 ha plot. Reflectance images and within stand radiation were simulated for different scales of analysis, viewing and illumination configurations, and leaf biomass. This stressed the great dependence of remote sensing measurements and within stand absorbed PAR upon experimental conditions. We also investigated the impact of forest structure on two hypotheses commonly used for simulating CO2 assimilation and for relating this quantity to remote sensing: within stand PAR exponential profiles, and constant ratio of light absorPtion among leaves. Finally, this work stressed the potential of the DART model, alone or with remote sensing, to better understand PAR environment and consequently photosynthetic responses of tropical rain forest.","PAR; Photosynthesis; Radiative transfer model; Remote sensing; Sumatra; Tropical rain forest","modelling; photosynthetically active radiation; rainforest; remote sensing; Indonesia, Sumatra",,,,,,,,,,,,"Gastellu-Etchegorry, J.P.; Centre d'Etude de la Biosphere, 18 Av.

In this study, the C pools in the terrestrial ecosystems of the former Soviet Union (SUf), conterminous United States (USc), and Brazil were estimated for a nominal 1990 base year. Data sources included recent vegetation maps, resource inventories, (particularly for forests), and published values for C densities (mass per unit area). Methodology varied by nation depending upon data availability but generally consisted of identifying a suitable land cover classification system, quantifying the area of each land cover type using traditional mapping approaches or satellite remote sensing, and assigning a mean C density to each cover type with separation by phytomass, litter plus coarse woody debris, and soil. Total organic C for the 3 geographic areas was estimated at 839 Pg (Pg = g × 1015) C in 1990, 38% of a literature-based estimate of the global terrestrial-C pool on an area representing 28% of the world's lands (excluding Antarctica). The soil C pool was the largest component in the SUf (84 % of the total) and USc (76%) but not in Brazil (47%). Correspondingly, the proportion as phytomass was greatest in Brazil (48%) compared to the SUf (10%) and USc (17%). The forest land cover class contained by far the largest proportion of C among the land cover classes except in the SUf where peatlands were dominant with 37 % of the total. The 2 largest C pools isolated in this study are potentially long-term sources of C to the atmosphere: soil C in peatlands of SUf (212 Pg) which may be lost via climate change, and phytomass C in the tropical-moist forests of Brazil (105 Pg) which may be lost via deforestation.","Brazil; Carbon pools; Former Soviet Union; Terrestrial ecosystems; United States","biosphere; carbon pool; terrestrial ecosystem; Brazil; Russian Federation; USA",,,,,,,,,,,,"Turner, D.P.; Department of Forest Science, , Corvallis, OR 97331, United States; email: turnerd@fsl.orst.edu",,"Inter-Research",0936577X,,,,"English","Clim.

The test sites are located in the boreal forest zone in Finland. SSM/I data from snow-free periods (from May to September) are used in the study, together with a digital high-resolution land use map as reference data. A stepwise algorithm is developed, in which the surface emissivity is estimated for each of the pixels in the first stage of the algorithm. By using a training data set (50% of all data), empirical coefficients for the subpixel land use and forest stem volume are determined. The results for subpixel land use classification (retrieval of fractions of individual land use categories contained within study pixels) are promising. When there are two or three categories to retrieve, the rms errors range from 3% to 9%, and the respective relative errors from 3% to 32%. When there are six categories to retrieve, the performance is less satisfactory, with relative errors exceeding 100% for some categories. For the retrieval of forest stem volume, a similar approach is used. The validation data set shows rms errors (standard errors) of approximately 20 m3/ha when the mean estimated forest stem volume is around 70 m3/ha. When compared to reported Landsat TM-based biomass estimates for a study area in Finland, the r2 (coefficient of determination) values are comparable. The methods are also validated for a wider use by limiting the training data set to either northern or southern Finland, since the surface and forest types in these areas are systematically different (subgroups of boreal forests). The results show that the methods are applicable to remote areas with less training data. This is especially true for the stem volume estimation and limited (two or three classes) subpixel land use classification.

The magnitude and variability of the response of the L-band SAR to above-ground biomass density was quantified using field data collected at Tapajos in central Amazonia and imagery from a series of dates. A simple backscatter model was fitted to this response and validated using image and field data acquired independently at Manaus, 500 km to the west of Tapajos. The sources of variability in biomass density and SAR backscatter were investigated so as to determine confidence limits for the subsequent retrieval of biomass density using the model. This analysis suggested that only three broad classes of regenerating forest biomass density may be positively distinguished. While the backscatter appears to saturate at around 60 tonnes per hectare, the biomass limit for retrieval purposes which is tolerant to both speckle and image texture is only 31 tonnes per hectare. The spatial distribution of biomass density in central Amazonia was estimated by applying the model to a mosaic of 90 JERS-1 images.

The model was initialized with extensive field measurements of Populus tremuloides Michx. and Picea mariana (Mill.) BSP stand properties. The results showed that the proportion of total carbon assimilation expended in autotrophic respiration (i.e., the respiration to assimilation ratio, R/A) was significantly different for the two tree species and this explained much of the variability in the amount of net production per unit absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (APAR), referred to as PAR utilization (εn). This is the first known study to directly link variability in respiratory costs to εn. Total assimilation per unit APAR (εg) was much less variable than En and was not significantly different between species. Greater stomatal control on some moisture stressed sites accounted for most of the variability in εg. The lack of a simple relationship between light harvesting and net carbon gain indicates that estimation of net primary production with satellite remote sensing requires additional information on respiration costs; however, evidence for convergence in εg can be used to simplify the remote sensing of gross primary production over large areas.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Goetz, S.J.; Department of Geography, , College Park, MD 20742, United States; email: sgoetz@geog.umd.edu",,"National Research Council of Canada",00455067,,CJFRA,,"English","Can J Forest Res",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85086526481

The parameters of interest were forest coverage fraction and forest stem volume (biomass). The employed test sites covered almost the whole of Finland. Two measurement periods were used: July through September in 1993 and January through February in 1994. The apparent emissivities of various land cover types were determined with the mixed pixel approach under summer and winter conditions. The aim was to define the dominating factors on emissivity under winter and summer conditions. The mixed pixel approach was tested for the estimation of forest coverage fraction. The results with multitemporal SSM/I data show that the pixel-wise fractions of water, nonforested, and forested area can be estimated with rms errors of around 10 percent units. The correlation between the estimates and the ground truth was over 0.85. A new inversion method for stem volume estimation was presented. At SSM/I frequencies the forest canopy and the snow-covered ground dominate the emissivity behavior under winter conditions in the boreal forest zone. The method is based on the fact that the emissivity of forest canopy is close to 1, while that of dry snow cover is relatively low.

These observations were obtained from the NASA ER-2 aircraft as part of the Smoke, Clouds, and Radiation-Brazil (SCAR-B) campaign, conducted over a 1500 × 1500 km region of cerrado and rain forest throughout Brazil between August 16 and September 11, 1995. Multispectral images of the reflection function and brightness temperature in 10 distinct bands of the MODIS airborne simulator (MAS) were used to derive a confidence in clear sky (or alternatively the probability of cloud), shadow, fire, and heavy aerosol. In addition to multispectral imagery, monostatic lidar data were obtained along the nadir ground track of the aircraft and used to assess the accuracy of the cloud mask results. This analysis shows that the cloud and aerosol mask being developed for operational use on the moderate-resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS), and tested using MAS data in Brazil, is quite capable of separating cloud, aerosol, shadow, and fires during daytime conditions over land.

The SCAR-B MAS data covered forest and cerrado regions with varying smoke concentration as a result of fires in August-September, 1995. Excellent agreement is obtained by comparing the retrieved aerosol optical thickness from the MAS data with AERONET (Aerosol Robotic Network) ground-based Sun photometer observations. The evaluation of MODIS aerosol algorithm was performed for a range of smoke optical thickness from 0.1 to 2 at 0.66 μm wavelength over cerrado and forest sites. All the retrieved values of optical thickness are found within the anticipated retrieval errors of Δτ= ±0.05±0.2τ. This confirms for smoke aerosol the validity of the MODIS algorithms and the use of the new dynamic aerosol models in this algorithm (the algorithm was already validated previously for urban/industrial aerosol). The retrieved optical thickness is found to be very sensitive to the assumed value of the singlescattering albedo but not sensitive to the aerosol refractive index (real part). The single-scattering albedo of 0.90 suggested in the aerosol model yields the best results. Test of the MODIS use of a grid box of 10 × 10 km in the aerosol algorithm shows that the standard deviation of the retrieved aerosol should generally not be more than 10% of the average value for a large range of optical thickness values from 0.2 to 2.0, close and far from fires.

A smoke aerosol physical and optical model is developed from a database of over 800 volume size distributions inverted from sky radiance data measured by the AERONET radiometer network in Brazil over a 3-year period. The model represents total column, ambient conditions during the burning season in the Amazon Basin and cerrado region of Brazil. The mean volume size distributions are bimodal and can be represented by two lognormals. Accumulation mode modal radius is 0.13 ± 0.02 μm with σ = 0.60 ± 0.04, and coarse-mode modal radius ranges from 6 to 40 μm, with a mean of 11.5 μm and σ = 1.26 ± 0.23. The volume of each mode varies with optical thickness, causing the ratio of accumulation mode and coarse mode to vary as well, but the effect on the optical properties is negligible. Refractive index is taken to be 1.43-0.0035i, and single scattering albedo is assumed to be 0.90, which is modeled with an external mixing of black carbon. The optical properties in the visible are dominated by the accumulation mode. Accumulation mode characteristics do not vary from year to year, from forest to cerrado region, with optical thickness or with precipitable water vapor. At one test location, accumulation mode characteristics do vary with air mass trajectory origin. The model is tested with independent data and can accurately predict the scattering phase function and path radiance in the backscattering direction that determines remote sensing properties and is responsible for scattering sunlight back to space.

The MODIS instrument will sense fires with designated 3.9 and 11 μ channels that saturate at high temperatures (450 and 400 K, respectively). MODIS data will be used to detect fires, to estimate the rate of emission of radiative energy from the fire, and to estimate the fraction of biomass burned in the smoldering phase. The rate of emission of radiative energy is a measure of the rate of combustion of biomass in the fires. In the Smoke, Clouds, and Radiation-Brazil (SCAR-B) experiment the NASA ER-2 aircraft flew the MODIS airborne simulator (MAS) to measure the fire thermal and mid-IR signature with a 50 m spatial resolution. These data are used to observe the thermal properties and sizes of fires in the cerrado grassland and Amazon forests of Brazil and to simulate the performance of the MODIS 1 km resolution fire observations. Although some fires saturated the MAS 3.9 μm channel, all the fires were well within the MODIS instrument saturation levels. Analysis of MAS data over different ecosystems, shows that the fire size varied from single MAS pixels (50 × 50 m) to over 1 km2. The 1 × 1 km resolution MODIS instrument can observe only 30-40% of these fires, but the observed fires are responsible for 80 to nearly 100% of the emitted radiative energy and therefore for 80 to 100% of the rate of biomass burning in the region. The rate of emission of radiative energy from the fires correlated very well with the formation of fire burn scars (correlation coefficient = 0.97). This new remotely sensed quantity should be useful in regional estimates of biomass consumption. This paper is not subject to U.S. copyright.

In many parts of the boreal zone, fire drives vegetation succession, landscape dynamics and carbon cycling. Global climate change may affect the frequency and size of wildfires and alter the rate of carbon release into the atmosphere. Monitoring changes in fire frequency are therefore vital for forest management and predicting climate change impacts. The continuity of remotely sensed data, combined with the extent and remoteness of the boreal ecosystem make Earth observation an important tool for fire monitoring. This Letter examines the applicability of data from SPOT-Vegetation for regional fire monitoring in the context of other available Earth observation instruments.

The results are characterized for four major ecosystems, namely, 1) tropical rain forest, 2) tropical broadleaf seasonal, 3) savanna/grass and seasonal woods (SGW), and 4) mild/warm/hot grass/shrub (MGS). The spatial and temporal distribution of fires are examined from two different methods using the multispectral Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer Local Area Coverage data. Using collocated measurements from the instantaneous scanner Earth Radiation Budget Experiment data, the direct regional radiative forcing of biomass burning aerosols is computed. The results show that more than 70% of the fires occur in the MGS and SGW ecosystems due to agricultural practices. The smoke generated from biomass burning has negative instantaneous net radiative forcing values for all four major ecosystems within South America. The smoke found directly over the fires has mean net radiative forcing values ranging from -25.6 to -33.9 W m-2. These results confirm that the regional net radiative impact of biomass burning is one of cooling. The spectral and broadband properties for clear-sky and smoke regions are also presented that could be used as input and/or validation for other studies attempting to model the impact of aerosols on the earth-atmosphere system. These results have important applications for future instruments from the Earth Observing System (EOS) program. Specifically, the combination of the Visible Infrared Scanner and Clouds and the Earth's Radiant Energy System (CERES) instruments from the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission and the combination of Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectrometer and CERES instruments from the EOS morning crossing mission could provide reliable estimates of the direct radiative forcing of aerosols on a global scale, thereby reducing the uncertainties in current global aerosol radiative forcing values.",,"aerosol; biomass burning; cooling; radiative forcing; satellite imagery; South America",,,,,,,,,,,,"Christopher, S.A.; Department of Atmospheric Sciences, 977 Explorer Blvd., Huntsville, AL 35899, United States; email: sundar@atmos.uah.edu",,"American Meteorological Society",08948763,,,,"English","J.

Estimates of carbon pools and fluxes to the atmosphere were carried out using the results of Landsat image analysis and published data about carbon stocks in vegetation and soil. The results showed that a large amount of carbon (12 103 g cm2) is released after three years under pasture. From the initial burning and after fifth year under pasture, the system functioned as a source of CO2 to atmosphere.

The model was initialized with extensive field measurements of Populus tremuloides Michx, and Picea mariana (Mill.) BSP stand properties. The results showed that the proportion of total carbon assimilation expended in autotrophic respiration (i.e., the respiration to assimilation ratio, R/A) was significantly different for the two tree species and this explained much of the variability in the amount of net production per unit absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (APAR), referred to as PAR utilization (ε(n)). This is the first known study to directly link variability in respiratory costs to ε(n). Total assimilation per unit APAR (ε(g)) was much less variable than ε(n) and was not significantly different between species. Greater stomatal control on some moisture stressed sites accounted for most of the variability in ε(g). The lack of a simple relationship between light harvesting and net carbon gain indicates that estimation of net primary production with satellite remote sensing requires additional information on respiration costs; however, evidence for convergence in ε(g) can be used to simplify the remote sensing of gross primary production over large areas.",,"boreal forest; carbon; light utilization; net primary production; photosynthetically active radiation; remote sensing; Minnesota; USA; Picea mariana; Picea mariana; Populus tremuloides; Populus tremuloides",,,,,,,,,,,,"Goetz, S.J.; Department of Geography, , College Park, MD 20742, United States; email: sgoetz@geog.umd.edu",,"Canadian Science Publishing",00455067,,CJFRA,,"English","Can.

It has been hypothesised that the terrestrial biosphere in general and tropical forests in particular are acting as major sinks for atmospheric carbon. A possible mechanism for these sinks is the rapid regeneration of forests following the abandonment of previously cleared land. To quantify the amount of carbon sequestered by regenerating tropical forests requires data on their location and, since it is known that young regenerating forests grow faster and sequester more carbon than do old regenerating forests, data on their age. The biophysical properties of regenerating forests change with age and are different from those of the surrounding mature forests. Certain key biophysical properties can be detected, at least in principle, using satellite sensor data recorded in red and near infrared (NIR) wavelengths. However, while the relationship between red and NIR radiation and biophysical properties is generally strong in temperate forests, it has proved to be relatively weak for tropical forests. To overcome the problems of using red and NIR radiation in studies of tropical forests alternative approaches must be sought and one such approach includes the use of remotely sensed data acquired at other wavelengths (e.g., middle infrared (MIR) wavelengths (3.0-5.0 μm). Recent research suggests that biophysical properties may be related strongly to middle infrared (MIR) radiation. This review outlines the important role that remote sensing can play in quantifying the carbon cycle and the reasons for a strong relationship between MIR radiation and the biophysical properties of tropical forests. It is concluded that remote sensing in MIR wavelengths could have an important part to play in enhancing our understanding of the processes that result in the current concentrations of atmospheric CO2.","Global carbon budget; Middle infrared; Tropical forests","Atmospheric composition; Atmospheric radiation; Carbon dioxide; Forestry; Infrared radiation; Sensor data fusion; Scientific information systems; Remote sensing",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Harwood Academic Publishers GmbH",02757257,,RSRVE,,"English","Remote Sens Rev",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031635636

Photographs of the forest canopy were taken using a camera fitted with a wide-angle fisheye lens from a number of locations within a stand. The photographs were later digitized and estimates of stand percentage canopy closure were derived using image processing software. It was found that C-band HV and VV, and L-band HV and VV polarization backscatter were significantly related to stem biomass. There was no sensitivity to percentage canopy closure using single polarization backscatter but highly significant relationships were obtained using ratios of single polarization backscatter and variables derived from the polarization signatures.

The goal of this paper is to present progress in mapping above ground woody biomass over portions of the BOREAS southern study area using spaceborne sensor data. Relationships of backscatter to total biomass and total biomass to foliage, branch, and bole biomass are used to estimate biomass across the landscape. The procedure involves image classification with SAR and Landsat data and development of simple mapping techniques using combinations of SAR channels. The analysis uses measurements from forest stands representing a range of biomass and structures. Field measurements included plot level mensuration (species, stem diameter, height, density, and basal area) and tree geometry measurements (leaf, branch, bole size, and angle distributions). The results indicate that aboveground biomass can be estimated to within about 1.6 kg/m2 and up to about 15 kg/m2 across the SIR-C image evaluated. A general method produced equivalent results with those obtained by treating forest type (pine, spruce, and aspen) separately. The biomass mapping was extended to bole, branch, and foliage components from relationships with total aboveground biomass developed from detailed tree measurements. Average biomass within the imaged area was estimated to be about 7.3 kg/m2 with biomass components of bole, branch, and foliage comprising 83, 12, and 5% of the total. Examination of the scaling of biomass estimates from remote sensing images of varying resolution shows that information at scales useful for ecosystem models can be obtained. In addition, the biomass estimation technique provides similar information at different image resolutions.",,"biomass; biomass estimation; Boreal Ecosystem-Atmosphere Study; boreal forest; BOREAS; forest biomass; mapping; radar; remote sensing; SAR; satellite sensing; synthetic aperture radar; Canada; Picea",,,,,,,,,,,,"Ranson, K.J.; Biospheric Sciences Branch, , Greenbelt, MD, United States",,"Blackwell Publishing Ltd",01480227,,,,"English","J.

Unfortunately, we have relatively little knowledge regarding fire activities in the boreal ecosystem. This study investigates the extent and dynamics of the forest fires occurred in and around the Boreal Ecosystem-Atmosphere Study (BOREAS) region during summer 1994, an active fire season on record. The statistics of fire activities were obtained from advanced very high resolution radiometer (AVHRR) (aboard NOAA 11) data employing two satellite-based remote sensing techniques that were designed particularly for monitoring boreal forest fires. Active fires and burned area are estimated using single-day images and 10-day clear composites. Such basic fire attributes as the area and period of burning extracted from the satellite data are compared against the ground reports made by the fire management agencies in Saskatchewan and Manitoba, Canada. Overall, there were 99 fires of a total burning area of approximately 2 million ha found over an area of 800 × 700 km2 around the BOREAS study region in summer 1994. Agreement in the area of burning is good between the surface observations and satellite-based estimation using single-day images but poor using the composite data that suffer from various uncertainties. The majority (87%) of the ground-reported fires were detected by satellite; the satellite also identified some fires missed by the ground observers. Most fires in 1994 occurred in the transitional forest to the north and northwest of the BOREAS region. Regarding to the monitoring of fire evolution, the daily satellite detection approach can be as effective as or even more effective than ground observations, provided that cloud cover does not occur persistently. The smoke of the fires had an impact on some BOREAS flux measurements.",,"AVHRR; biomass burning; boreal ecosystem; Boreal Ecosystem-Atmosphere Study; BOREAS; fire; monitoring; remote sensing; Canada, Manitoba; Canada, Saskatchewan",,,,,,,,,,,,"Li, Z.; Canada Centre for Remote Sensing, Ottawa, Ont., Canada; email: li@ccrs.emr.ca",,"Blackwell Publishing Ltd",01480227,,,,"English","J.

Feather mosses and lichens (forests), brown mosses (rich fens), and Sphagnum species (bogs and poor fens) were collected from sites in the northern study area (NSA) of the Boreal Ecosystem-Atmosphere Study (BOREAS) near Thompson, Manitoba, and from three peatlands in southeastern New Hampshire. Because mosses are indirect indicators of soil moisture, trace gas flux, and carbon accumulation, these data may enable hyperspectral remote sensing systems, such as the airborne visible and infrared imaging spectrometer and the compact airborne spectrographic imager (AVIRIS) (CASI), as well as future systems such as Lewis and the first New Millennium Project, to infer differences in hydrology and carbon cycling in boreal ecosystems at small spatial scales (&lt;1-900 m2). Mosses exhibit distinctly different spectral characteristics from vascular plants in the visible, near-infrared (NIR) and short-wave infrared (SWIR) regions. In the visible portion of the spectrum, mosses exhibit typical absorption in the blue and red regions but differ from vascular plants in having a ""green"" peak reflective of the color (red, brown, or green) of the individual species. The moss reflectance in the NIR spectral region is typically less reflective than the same region in vascular plants and is characterized by strong water absorption features located at approximately 1.00 and 1.20 μm, resulting in pronounced reflectance peaks at approximately 0.85, 1.10, and 1.30 μm (identified as NIR 1, 2, and 3, respectively). The variations in the relative brightness of the three NIR peaks in each of the three groups of mosses (Sphagnum, feather, and brown mosses) are diagnostic and may be indicative of different cellular characteristics. The slope of the NIR plateau as determined by the NIR 3/1 ratio, as well as the shape of the NIR 1 peak and relative dominance of NIR 2, separate the three groups. In addition, the NIR 1 peak in Sphagnum species is marked by a minor absorption feature at 0.85 μm, which is absent in all brown mosses and feather mosses, as well as in vascular plants. Because this absorption feature results in a narrow NIR 1 peak, and the red absorption is also narrow in Sphagnum, the standard normalized difference vegetation index/simple vegetation index ratio (NDVI/VI) methods do not work well in characterizing biomass or greenness. The overall reflectance of mosses in the SWIR region (1.50-2.50 μm) is lower than that of vascular plants because of the higher water content of the moss tissue. In lichens, reflectance in this region is higher than either mosses or vascular plants, due likely to tissue dryness. The lichens included in this study are most dissimilar from mosses and vascular plants in the visible portion of the spectrum.",,"Bryophyta; Sphagnum; Tracheophyta; Sphagnum; Boreal Ecosystem-Atmosphere Study; boreal forest; BOREAS; lichen; moss; peatlands; remote sensing; spectral reflectance; wetlands; Canada, Manitoba, Thompson; USA, New Hampshire",,,,,,,,,,,,"Bubier, J.L.; Complex Systems Research Center, , Durham, NH, United States; email: jill.bubier@unh.edu",,"Blackwell Publishing Ltd",01480227,,,,"English","J.

The land cover classification was developed by using regional field observations from ground and low-level aircraft transits to analyze spectral-temporal clusters that were derived from an unsupervised cluster analysis of monthly normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) image composites (April-September 1992). Quantitative areal proportions of the major boreal forest components were determined for a 821 km × 619 km region, ranging from the southern grasslands-boreal forest ecotone to the northern boreal transitional forest. The boreal wetlands (mostly lowland black spruce, tamarack, mosses, fens, and bogs) occupied approximately 33% of the region, while lakes accounted for another 13%. Upland mixed coniferous-deciduous forests represented 23% of the ecosystem. A SW-NE productivity gradient across the region is manifested by three levels of tree stand density for both the boreal wetland conifer and the mixed forest classes, which are generally aligned with isopleths of regional growing degree days. Approximately 30% of the region was directly affected by fire disturbance within the preceding 30-35 years, especially in the Canadian Shield Zone where large fire-regeneration patterns contribute to the heterogeneous boreal landscape. Intercomparisons with land cover classifications derived from 30-m Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) data provided important insights into the relative accuracy of the 1 km AVHRR land cover classification. Primarily due to the multitemporal NDVI image compositing process, the 1 km AVHRR land cover classes have an effective spatial resolution in the 3-4 km range; therefore fens, bogs, small water bodies, and small patches of dry jack pine cannot be resolved within the wet conifer mosaic. Major differences in the 1-km AVHRR and 30-m Landsat TM-derived land cover classes are most likely due to differences in the spatial resolution of the data sets. In general, the 1 km AVHRR land cover classes are vegetation mosaics consisting of mixed combinations of the Landsat classes. Detailed mapping of the global boreal forest with this approach will benefit from algorithms for cloud screening and to atmospherically correct reflectance data for both aerosol and water vapor effects. We believe that this 1 km AVHRR land cover analysis provides new and useful information for regional water, energy, carbon, and trace gases studies in BOREAS, especially given the significant spatial variability in land cover type and associated biophysical land cover parameters (e.g., albedo, leaf area index, FPAR, and surface roughness). Multiresolution land cover comparisons (30 m, 1 km, and 100 km grid cells) also illustrated how heterogeneous landscape patterns are represented in land cover maps with differing spatial scales and provided insights on the requirements and challenges for parameterizing landscape heterogeneity as part of land surface process research.",,"AVHRR; Boreal Ecosystem-Atmosphere Study; boreal forest; BOREAS; fire; fire regeneration; forest ecosystem; image classification; land cover; Landsat Thematic Mapper; Landsat TM; mapping; remote sensing; spatial scale; Canada; Bryophyta; Coniferophyta; Larix laricina; Picea mariana; Pinus banksiana",,,,,,,,,,,,"Steyaert, L.T.; EROS Data Center, , Greenbelt, MD, United States",,"Blackwell Publishing Ltd",01480227,,,,"English","J.

To address these problems, we develop an integrated, physically based classification and biophysical characteristics estimation algorithm that utilizes canopy reflectance models to account directly for signature variations from Sun angle, topographic, and other variations. Our approach fuses into a single algorithm both land cover classification and biophysical characteristics estimation, permitting one set of physically based canopy reflectance models to be used for both. The use of canopy reflectance models eliminates the need for unrealistic assumptions, such as multivariate-normal distributions, underlying many classification algorithms. Using the algorithm, we have classified a 10,000 km2 area of the BOREAS southern study area. Our classification shows that low-productivity wetland conifer is the dominant land cover and that nearly 7% of the area is occupied by boreal fens, a major source of methane. In addition, nearly 23% of the area has been disturbed by either fire or logging in the last 20 years, suggesting an important role for disturbance to the regional carbon budget. A thorough evaluation of the physically based classifier within the southern study area shows accuracies superior to those obtained with conventional statistically based algorithms, implying even better performance when extended over multiple Landsat frames since the physically based approach can account directly for regional variations in reflectance resulting from varying illumination and viewing conditions (topography, Sun angle). The conifer biomass density estimation algorithm is based on our discovery of a convenient natural relationship between crown height and volumetric density that renders the biomass density for black spruce stands independent of tree height, and a function only of sunlit canopy fraction. This permits us to calculate directly the relationship between reflectance and biomass density. An evaluation of the algorithm using ground sites shows our algorithm can estimate black spruce biomass density with a root-mean-square error of 2.73 kg/m2 for correctly classified sites. Our evaluation also demonstrates the importance of correct classification. Rootmean-square errors for misclassified sites were 3.96 kg/m2. Using this approach we have estimated the biomass density in the BOREAS southern study area for the dominant land cover type in the circumpolar boreal ecosystem, wetland black spruce. These results show a bimodality to the biomass density regional distribution, controlled perhaps by underlying topographic and edaphic factors.",,"algorithm; biophysical characteristic; biophysical classification; Boreal Ecosystem-Atmosphere Study; boreal forest; BOREAS; canopy reflectance; image classification; land cover; mapping; remote sensing; satellite imagery; vegetation cover; Canada; Coniferophyta; Picea mariana",,,,,,,,,,,,"Hall, F.G.; NASA Goddard Space Flight Center, Greenbelt, MD, United States; email: fghall@ltpmail.gsfc.nasa.gov",,"Blackwell Publishing Ltd",01480227,,,,"English","J.

For coniferous, evergreen forest species, the summer frost free period bounds the growing season length and period of net carbon uptake. Spring soil thaw bounds the period of soil respiration and decomposition and thus carbon release. The balance of these two exchanges determines whether the boreal region is a net carbon source or sink. Imaging radar data can potentially be used to monitor these periods of soil and canopy thaw due to the sensitivity of radar to surface freeze/thaw state. In considering the use of imaging radar, two issues must be addressed. First, the temporal relationship between the time of freezing and thawing of the forest canopy and soil and the periods of photosynthetic and respiration activity must be ascertained. Second, the sensitivity of imaging radar to freeze/ thaw processes in each of the forest components must be assessed. Of particular interest is the extent to which radar is selectively sensitive to tree and soil thawing. In 1994, in situ soil, stem and root temperatures, and stem xylem flux were measured over a complete annual cycle at the Boreal Ecosystem-Atmosphere Study (BOREAS) test sites in Canada. Imaging radar data from the European Space Agency Remote Sensing (ERS-1) satellite were also acquired throughout 1994. The in situ temperature data show clear transitions in soil and stem thawing related to the start of soil respiration and canopy photosynthesis, respectively. The imaging radar data show clear shifts in backscatter related directly to soil thaw, and possibly to canopy thaw, as two independent transitions. These results are compared to seasonal ecosystem model results for carbon exchange.",,"boreal forest; BOREAS; carbon exchange; ERS-1; radar; soil respiration; thaw; Canada",,,,,,,,,,,,"Way, J.; Jet Propulsion Laboratory, 4800 Oak Grove Drive, Pasadena, CA 91109, United States; email: way@lor.jpl.nasa.gov",,"Blackwell Publishing Ltd",01480227,,,,"English","J.

Our studies aim on investigating the capability of microwaves for monitoring forest vitality. Reduced forest tree vitality and reduced canopy biomass are often a consequence of disadvantageous stand conditions like lack of water supply and low nutrient availability in the soil. Pollutants in the air and the soil can negatively affect the metabolism of the trees and cause visible decline symptoms. Reduced vitality ultimately leads to a decreasing leaf or needle biomass and thus canopy density. We further assume that a direct relationship exists between the variations of the tree water status and the canopy density, stand vitality and forest decline. Since the dielectric constant of water is much higher than of other tree constituents, microwave signatures contain direct information on the water status of forest canopies.

The present work demonstrates the feasibility of a nonimaging helicopter-borne ranging scatterometer for standwise forest inventory. The radar-derived stand profiles were compared with the standwise field inventory data by applying multivariate data analysis methods. The 1300 ha Teijo test site, locating 130 km west of Helsinki, was divided into 18 parallel radar flight lines with a 150 m spacing. A total of 28 radar variables, including profile information and ground and crown backscatter contributions at 5. 4 and 9. 8 GHz (polarizations VV, HV, and HH), were used in regression model development. The capability of a ranging radar to classify development class, land use class, bog type and fertility (site) class was demonstrated for the first time. The accuracy of the radar-derived estimates for mean height was 1. 6 m (13%) meeting the requirement of operational use. The obtained stem volume accuracy of 31 m3/ha (26%) was slightly better than has been obtained by aerial photographs. The accuracy of stem volume estimation could be easily improved by decreasing the space between flight lines. However, this leads to considerable increase in flight costs, and, therefore, a scanning ranging radar capable of producing threedimensional (3-D) images of forests would be a better alternative. © 1997 IEEE.",,"Classification (of information); Estimation; Forestry; Mathematical models; Radar; Remote sensing; Scanning; Three dimensional; Nanoimaging; Ranging radar; Scaterometer; Standwise forest inventory; Radar imaging","Alfred Kordelinin Säätiö; Academy of Finland; Tekes; Jenny ja Antti Wihurin Rahasto","Manuscript received September 15, 1994; revised July 31, 1996.

K1A 0Y7, Canada","This paper describes a boreal ecosystems productivity simulator (BEPS) recently developed at the Canada Centre for Remote Sensing to assist in natural resources management and to estimate the carbon budget over Canadian landmass (106-107 km2). BEPS uses principles of FOREST biogeochemical cycles (FOREST-BGC) (Running and Coughlan, 1988) for quantifying the biophysical processes governing ecosystems productivity, but the original model is modified to better represent canopy radiation processes. A numerical scheme is developed to integrate different data types: remote sensing data at 1-km resolution in lambert conformal conic projection, daily meteorological data in Gaussian or longitude-latitude gridded systems, and soil data grouped in polygons. The processed remote sensing data required in the model are leaf area index (LAI) and land-cover type. The daily meteorological data include air temperature, incoming shortwave radiation, precipitation, and humidity. The soil-data input is the available water-holding capacity. The major outputs of BEPS include spatial fields of net primary productivity (NPP) and evapotranspiration. The NPP calculated by BEPS has been tested against biomass data obtained in Quebec, Canada. A time series of LAI over the growing season of 1993 in Quebec was derived by using 10-day composite normalized difference vegetation index images acquired by the advanced very high resolution radiometer at 1-km resolution (resampled). Soil polygon data were mosaicked, georeferenced, and rasterized in a geographic information system (ARC/INFO). With the use of the process-based model incorporating all major environmental variables affecting plant growth and development, detailed spatial distributions of NPP (annual and four seasons) in Quebec are shown in this paper. The accuracy of NPP calculation is estimated to be 60% for single pixels and 75% for 3 x 3 pixel areas (9 km8). The modeled NPP ranges from 0.6 kg C/m2/year at the southern border to 0.01 kg C/m2/year at the northern limit of the province. The total annual NPP in Quebec is estimated to be 0.24 Gt C in 1993, which is about 0.3-0.4% of the global NPP.",,"Boreal ecosystem productivity simulator; Normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI); Ecosystems; Evapotranspiration; Geographic information systems; Mathematical models; Natural resources; Plants (botany); Radiometers; Soils; Time series analysis; Remote sensing; BEPS; bored ecosystem; carbon budget; ecosystem productivity; modelling; NDVL; net primary production; net primary productivity; remote sensing; resource management; Canada, Quebec","National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC: 39893360","We would like to thank Youhao Guo and Wei Li for helpful comments on the manuscripts and Yunhai Pu and Binghong Xiong for help in field sampling.

The objectives are to assess the regrowth pathways followed by different species populations after a disturbance, to analyze the speed of recovery in the years following fire, and, finally, to estimate rates of regrowth. The test area is located in the north of the province of Alicante, on the Mediterranean coast of Spain. This area, especially prone to forest fires, shows a remarkable land-use history and human pressure. The test areas belong to different microclimatic zones, show diverse vegetation communities, and have different degrees of stoniness; so we attempted to discover their postfire behaviors according to their biogeographical conditions. To accomplish these objectives, we used nine Landsat 5 thematic mapper images from 1984 to 1994 to which geometric and radiometric corrections were applied. Once the comparability between images was guaranteed, we generated a normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) for each date. First, we demonstrated that the differences between NDVI images were suitable for mapping burned areas. Second, we undertook a nonlinear regression analysis between NDVI values and the time elapsed since the fire to assess the recovery processes. The exponential adjustment between NDVI and time was in accord with the asymptotic behavior observed when the recovery process is complete. The parameters supplied by the proposed method are helpful in quantifying the effects of fire on different ecosystem processes.",,"Bio geographical conditions; Ecosystem recovery rate; Microclimatic zones; Normalized difference vegetation index; Satellite imagery; Stoniness; Thematic mapper; Vegetation; Ecology; Ecosystems; Fires; Geometry; Imaging techniques; Mapping; Mathematical models; Monitoring; Parameter estimation; Plants (botany); Satellites; Remote sensing; biomass burning; ecosystem recovery; fire; Landat TM; modelling; NDVI; remote sensing; satellite sensing; Spain, Valencia, Alicante",,"This work has been supported by CEAM (Centro de Estudios Ambient& de1 Mediterraneo), und it has been possible through the collaboration and general support of sezjerul insti-hltions and departnwnts, arrwng which we wish to acknowledge thcz Centro Meteorologico Territorial de Vulencia and the Carl- sellerirr de Me&o Ambiente.

Rapidly occurring land-cover and land-use change in the Western Ghats has serious implications for the biodiversity of the region. Both landscape changes as well as the distribution of biodiversity are phenomena with strong spatial correlates. Recent developments in remote-sensing technology and Geographic Information Systems (GIS) allow the use of a landscape ecology and spatial analysis approach to the problem of deforestation and biodiversity conservation in the Western Ghats. Applications of this approach include analyses of land-cover and land-use change; estimation of deforestation rates and rates of forest fragmentation; examination of the spatial correlates of forest loss and the socioeconomic drivers of land-use change; modelling of deforestation; analysis of the consequences of land-cover and land-use change in the form of climate change and change in distribution of biodiversity; biomass estimation; gap analysis of the effectiveness of the protected area network in conserving areas of importance for biodiversity conservation; and conservation planning.

Orographic effects combine with moisture-laden frontal systems originating in the Pacific Ocean to produce areas of very high precipitation on western slopes and dry basins of internal drainage on eastern flanks of the mountains. In the southern half of the region most of the runoff occurs during winter or spring, while in the northern part most occurs in summer, especially in glaciated basins. Analyses of long-term climatic and hydrological records, combined with palaeoclimatic reconstructions and simulations of future climates, are used as the basis for likely scenarios of climatic variations. The predicted hydrological response in northern California to a climate with doubled CO2 and higher temperatures is a decrease in the amount of precipitation falling as snow, and substantially increased runoff during winter and less in late spring and summer. One consequence of the predicted earlier runoff is higher salinity in summer and autumn in San Francisco Bay. In saline lakes, the incidence of meromixis and the associated reduction in nutrient supply and algal abundance is expected to vary significantly as runoff fluctuates. In subalpine lakes, global warming will probably will lead to increased productivity. Lacustrine productivity can also be altered by changes in wind regimes, drought-enhanced forest fires and maximal or minimal snowpacks associated with atmospheric anomalies such as El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) events. Reduced stream temperature from increased contributions of glacial meltwater and decreased channel stability from changed runoff patterns and altered sediment loads has the potential to reduce the diversity of zoobenthic communities in predominately glacier-fed rivers. Climatic warming is likely to result in reduced growth and survival of sockeye salmon in freshwater, which would, in turn, increase marine mortality. Further research activities should include expanded studies at high elevations and of glacier mass balances and glacial runoff, applications of remote sensing to monitor changes, further refinement of regional climatic models to improve forecasts of future conditions and continued analyses of long-term physical, chemical and biological data to help understand responses to future climates. ©1997 by John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd.","Climate change; Global warming; Hydrological response; Inland waters; Pacific Coastal Mountains; Western Great Basin","algae; Oncorhynchus nerka; Inland waters; Environmental impact; Glaciers; Global warming; Hydrology; Lakes; Rivers; Runoff; Snow; Thermal effects; Wind effects; Surface waters; carbon dioxide doubling; climate change; climatic change; freshwater ecosystem; hydrological response; hydrology; limnology; precipitation; runoff; saline lake; North America, Pacific Coast; North America, Western Great Basin",,,,,,,,,,,,"Melack, J.M.; Dept. of Ecol., , Santa Barbara, CA 93106, United States",,"John Wiley and Sons Ltd",08856087,,HYPRE,,"English","Hydrol.

Maximum value normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) composites (MVCs) were generated for every ten-day period over the two years of the study. Two techniques, one regression analysis and the other differencing, were applied to the NDVI-MVCs both before and after each fire event to determine detection thresholds of change and to delineate and objectively evaluate the burned surfaces. The comparisons between the single-fires burned areas predicted by the techniques and that provided by the Spanish Forestry Service (ground based) showed that the regression algorithm was more reliable, giving rise to virtually no bias (-0.9%) and a root mean square error (RMS) of 20.3% RMS error. Likewise, a comparison between the perimeters of the large fires supplied by official data (GPS-based) and those obtained by the regression method confirmed the validity of the technique not only calculating fire size but also for mapping of large forest fires.",,"AVHRR; biomass burning; composite; fire; forest fire; mapping; NDVI; NOAA; Normalized Difference Vegetation Index; numerical image analysis; remote sensing; Spain; Data reduction; Fires; Image analysis; Measurement errors; Radiometers; Regression analysis; Advanced very high resolution radiometers (AVHRR); Forest fires; Normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI); Remote sensing",,,,,,,,,,,,"Illera, P.; Dpto.

These studies showed that the relation between woody canopy cover and red reflectance varies with geographical location, season, and other factors. This paper models the relation between woody canopy cover and red reflectance, using two simple geometric canopy models developed by Li-Strahler and Jasinski, respectively. Model simulations show that the relation between canopy cover and red band reflectance is sensitive to changes in background reflectance, canopy reflectance, solar zenith angle, and topography, which together determine the intercept, slope, and linearity of the relation. The model results provide a theoretical framework that serves as a guide for the most effective conditions for the use of reflectance measurements to estimate canopy to be selected a priori. It is predicted that woody canopy cover is best estimated with the use of red band measurements acquired at a solar zenith angle less than 30°in a season when the contrast between background reflectance and canopy reflectance is the largest during the year.",,"Computer simulation; Image sensors; Mathematical models; Parameter estimation; Reflectometers; Satellites; Geometric canopy models; Red reflectance; Woody canopy covers; Remote sensing; canopy cover; canopy model; red band reflectance; reflectance; solar zenith angle; spectral reflectance; topography","National Aeronautics and Space Administration, NASA: NGT-30168","The paper is part of a research project supported by a grant from the National Aeronautics and Space Administration under Global Change Fellowship (NGT-30168).

Espaciais-INPE, Sao Paulo, Brazil","In this paper, the potential use of spaceborne polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data in mapping land-cover types and monitoring deforestation in tropics is studied. Here, the emphasis is placed on several clearing practices and forest regeneration that can be characterized by using the sensitivity of SAR channels to vegetation biomass and canopy structure. A supervised Bayesian classifier designed for SAR signal statistics is employed to separate five classes: primary forest, secondary forest, pasture-crops, quebradao, and disturbed forest. The L- and C-band polarimetric SAR data acquired during the shuttle imaging radar-C (SIR-C)/X-SAR space-shuttle mission in 1994 are used as input data to the classifier. The results are verified by field observation and comparison with the Landsat data acquired in August of 1994. The SAR data can delineate these five classes with approximately 72% accuracy. The confusion arises when separating old secondary forests from primary forest and the young ones from pasture-crops. It is shown that Landsat and SAR data carry complementary information about the vegetation structure that, when used in synergism, may increase the classification accuracy over secondary forest regrowth. When the number of land-cover types was reduced to three classes including primary forest, pasture-crops, and regrowth-disturbed forest, the accuracy of classification increased to 87%. A dimensionality analysis of the classifier showed that the accuracy can be further improved to 92% by reducing the feature space to L-band HH and HV channels. Comparison of SIR-C data acquired in April (wet period) and October (dry period) indicates that multi-temporal data can be used for monitoring deforestation; however, the data acquired during the wet season are not suitable for accurate land-cover classification.",,"deforestation; forest regeneration; land use; mapping; rainforest; regeneration; remote sensing; SAR; Shuttle Imaging Radar C; SIR-C; Spaceborne Imaging Radar C; supervised classification; Synthetic Aperture Radar; South America, Amazonia; Agriculture; Biomass; Data acquisition; Errors; Forestry; Image analysis; Mapping; Polarimeters; Synthetic aperture radar; Deforestation; Land cover mapping; Radar imaging","National Aeronautics and Space Administration; California Institute of Technology, Caltech","We would like to thank the @tees for their critiques amt suggestions that helped to improve the quality of the paper.

Systems and Applications, Inc., Lanham, MD, United States","In previous work by the authors, multifrequency, polarimetric airborne synthetic aperture radar (AIRSAR) data were used to characterize forest categories and biomass density of a forest area in Maine, USA. This study area was included as a test site for ecological studies during the Spaceborne Imaging Radar C/X-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (SIR-C/X-SAR) missions in 1994. The SIR-C/X-SAR missions provided the first opportunity for Earth scientists to receive multifrequency and multipolarization SAR data from space from a single platform. During the Space Radar Laboratory missions in April and October 1994, images from AIRSAR and SIR-C/X-SAR were acquired for the same areas within a few days of each other. In this paper, the capabilities of AIRSAR and SIR-C/X-SAR images for characterizing a northern hardwood-horeal transitional forest were evaluated and compared. The use of multiple frequency, polarimetric information to produce forest-cover classification, biomass estimates, and forest spatial pattern analysis were investigated. The results from SIR-C/X-SAR compared with those from AIRSAR were generally similar despite different available frequencies (C-band, L-band, X-band vs. C-band, L-band, P-band) and resolution (25.0 m vs. 8.3 m). AIRSAR data better enabled the mapping of stands of hardwood and mixed forests than did SIR-C/X-SAR data. However, SIR-C/X-SAR produced better classification results for conifer forest stands. There was no great benefit from using higher resolution for classification except for forest stands in which there were mixtures of species (i.e., hardwood and softwood). A comparison of the image data also showed that both instruments could provide reasonable estimates of biomass density up to about 15 kg/m2. At higher biomass levels, both AIRSAR and SIR-C showed the well-known biomass saturation effect. The average biomass densities determined from the AIRSAR and SIR-C images were reasonably close at 9.7 kg/m2 and 9.0 kg/m2, respectively. Finally, spatial character of the image data was examined by using perimeter and area relations and lacunarity analysis. The results were consistent between the two instruments and showed that the forest opening pattern were self-similar for openings greater than about 3 ha.",,"AIRSAR; biomass; biomass estimation; classification; forest classification; forest cover; instrument evaluation; mapping; radar; remote sensing; SAR; SIR-C/X-SAR; Spaceborne Imaging Radar C; X-band Synthetic Aperture Radar; USA, Maine; Biomass; Data reduction; Ecology; Electromagnetic wave polarization; Forestry; Image analysis; Mapping; Pattern recognition; Polarimeters; Synthetic aperture radar; Biomass densities; Forest cover mapping; Radar imaging","National Aeronautics and Space Administration, NASA: 462-43, 665 31","This work was supported by NASA through the SIR-C/X-SAR Project (RTOP No. 665 31) and the Forest Ecosystem Dynamics Project (RTOP No. 462-43).

Yet, several problems remain. Cloud cover creates data gaps that limit the possibility of complete and frequent assessments, and secondary growth is not well characterized. Active microwave sensors could complement these sensors because they operate independently of cloud cover and smoke and can detect differences in woody biomass and forest structure associated with various stages of forest clearing and regrowth. An example of comparison and synergy between the two techniques is discussed here. Polarimetric, C- (5.6 cm) and L-band (24 cm) frequency, radar data gathered in October 1994 by NASA's Spaceborne Imaging Radar C, on a test site southeast of the city of Porto Velho, in the state of Rondonia, Brazil, are analyzed in conjunction with one 1993 Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) scene, a 9-year time series of Satellite pour l'observation de la Terre (SPOT) XS data, two Japan Earth Resources Satellite (JERS-1) radar images from 1994 and 1995, and a field visit conducted in 1995. The C-band radar data are found to be of limited utility for mapping deforestation. At L-band, multiple polarizations are required to obtain a reliable classification. The single polarization, L-band, single date, JERS-1 data underestimate the extent of deforestation, especially during the wet season. With multiple polarizations, six classes of land cover, including one level of regrowth, are mapped with 90% accuracy, but intermediate regrowth 5-8 years of age is not well separated from the forest. The Landsat TM data identify deforested areas better but provide less information on residual woody biomass levels. Combining the two classifications, seven classes of land cover including two levels of regrowth are mapped with 93% accuracy. The results show that the deforestation rate for 1994 was 1.7%. Large variations in residual woody biomass are detected among new clearings. Half of the total deforested land is in some stage of regrowth but most of it is less than 5 years old. Secondary growth is therefore a significant form or land use that is recleared quickly.",,"classification; deforestation; forest regeneration; Landsat; mapping; regeneration; remote sensing; satellite imagery; SIR-C; Spaceborne Imaging Radar C; Brazil, Rondonia State, Porto Velho; Biomass; Electromagnetic wave polarization; Forestry; Mapping; Multispectral scanners; Optical sensors; Polarimeters; Deforestation; Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM); Secondary forest growth; Radar imaging","National Aeronautics and Space Administration; Jet Propulsion Laboratory","This work was partly carried out at the Jet Propulsio~ Laboratory, CaliforT~ia Ins'titute of Technology, under a contract with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration.

The biomass levels present in the test stands ranged between 0.0 and, 44.5 kg m-2. Two SIR-C data sets were used: one collected in April, 1994, when the soil conditions were very wet and the canopy was slightly wet from dew and a second collected in October, 1994, when the soils and canopy were dry. During the October mission, pine needles were completely flushed and the foliar biomass was twice as great in the forest stands as in April. Four methods were evaluated to estimate total biomass: one including a straight multiple linear correlation between total biomass and the various SIR-C channels; another including a ratio of the L-band HV/C-and HV channels; and two others requiring multiple steps, where linear regression equations for different stand components (height, basal area, and crown or branch biomass) were used as the basis for estimating total biomass. It was shown that the data collected in October (dry soil conditions) were better for estimation of biomass than the data collected in April (wet soil cnjs). Overall, a multistep approach resulted in the lowest root mean square (RMS) errors (5.91 kg m-2) when biomass levels were &lt;20 kg m-2. For all biomass levels, the simple regression technique resulted in the lowest RMS errors (8.1 kg m-2). The multiple-step approaches have the additional advantage of being able to provide estimates of different components of stand structure and biomass, such as average tree height, basal area, branch biomass, canopy biomass, trunk biomass, and foliage biomass. The LHV channel is the critical element in all the biomass equations, as would be expected from the body of literature. The addition of other channels - generally, CHV or CHH - significantly improves biomass estimates, whether as a ratio or as additional terms in a regression equation.",,"aboveground biomass; biomass; biomass estimation; numerical image analysis; pine forest; radar; remote sensing; Shuttle Imaging Radar C; SIR-C; Spaceborne Imaging Radar C; USA, (Southeast); Biomass; Correlation methods; Electromagnetic wave polarization; Errors; Regression analysis; Biomass estimation; Multiple polarization radar imagery; Radar imaging","National Aeronautics and Space Administration, NASA","The research reported in this paper was performed through grants' w the Environmental Research Institute of Michigan and Duke University from the Jet Propulsion Laboratory through funds' provided by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration.

In this paper, we evaluate the model-generated patterns of spatial variability within and between ecosystems using Century, TEM, and Biome-BGC, and the relationships between modeled water balance, nutrients, and carbon dynamics. We present evaluations of models against mapped and site-specific data. In this analysis, we compare model-generated patterns of variability in net primary productivity (NPP) and soil organic carbon (SOC) to, respectively, a satellite proxy and mapped SOC from the VEMAP soils database (derived from USDA-NRCS [Natural Resources Conservation Service] information) and also compare modeled results to site-specific data from forests and grasslands. The VEMAP models simulated spatial variability in ecosystem processes in substantially different ways, reflecting the models' differing implementations of multiple resource limitation of NPP. The models had substantially higher COrrelations across vegetation types compared to within vegetation types. All three models showed correlation among water use, nitrogen availability, and primary production, indicating that water and nutrient limitations of NPP were equilibrated with each other at steady state. This model result may explain a number of seemingly contradictory observations and provides a series of testable predictions. The VEMAP ecosystem models were implicitly or explicitly sensitive to disturbance in their simulation of NPP and carbon storage. Knowledge of the effects of disturbance (human and natural) and spatial data describing disturbance regimes are needed for spatial modeling of ecosystems. Improved consideration of disturbance is a key 'next step' for spatial ecosystem models.","Disturbance; Evapotranspiration; Model comparison and validation; Nitrogen mineralization; NPP; Remote sensing; Soil carbon","disturbance; ecosystem model; ecosystem process; net primary productivity; spatial variation; VEMAP; USA",,,,,,,,,,,,"Painter, T.; Department of Geography, , Santa Barbara, CA 93107, United States",,"Ecological Society of America",00129615,,ECMOA,,"English","Ecol.

It reviews policy measures that have been successfully applied at regional and project levels toward the reduction of atmospheric greenhouse gases. It also describes both national programs and jointly implemented international activities. The monitoring methods, and the items to monitor, differ across these categories. Remote sensing is a good approach for the monitoring of C conservation, but not for C substitution, which requires estimation of the fossil fuels that would be displaced and the continued monitoring of electricity generation sources. C storage, on the other hand, includes C in products which may be traded internationally.

P7B 5E1, Canada","Forest managers require accurate and timely data that describe vegetation conditions on cutover areas to assess vegetation development and prescribe actions necessary to achieve forest regeneration objectives. Needs for such data are increasing with current emphasis on ecosystem management, escalating silvicultural treatment costs, evolving computer-based decision support tools, and demands for greater accountability. Deficiencies associated with field survey methods of data acquisition (e.g. high costs, subjectivity, and low spatial and temporal coverage) frequently limit decision-making effectiveness. The potential for remotely sensed data to supplement field-collected forest vegetation management data was evaluated in a problem analysis consisting of a comprehensive literature review and consultation with remote sensing and vegetation management experts at a national workshop. Among curently available sensors, aerial photographs appear to offer the most suitable combination of characteristics, including high spatial resolution, stereo coverage, a range of image scales, a variety of film, lens, and camera options, capability for geometric correction, versatility, and moderate cost. A flexible strategy that employs a sequence of 1:10,000-, 1:5,000-, and 1:500-scale aerial photographs is proposed to: 1) accurately map cutover areas, 2) facilitate location-specific prescriptions for silvicultural treatments, sampling, buffer zones, wildlife areas, etc., and 3) monitor and document conditions and activities at specific points during the regeneration period. Surveys that require very detailed information on smaller plants (<0.5-m tall) and/or individual or rare plant species are not likely to be supported by current remote sensing technologies. Recommended areas for research include: 1) digital frame cameras, or other cost-effective digital imagers, as replacements for conventional cameras, 2) computer-based classification and interpretation algorithms for digital image data, 3) relationships between image measures and physical measures, such as leaf-area index and biomass, 4) imaging standards, 5) airborne video, laser altimeters, and radar as complementary sensors, and 6) remote sensing applications in partial cutting systems.","Aerial photography; Forest vegetation management; Regeneration; Remote sensing",,,,,,,,,,,,,"Pitt, D.G.; Canadian Forest Service, P.O.

These two model inputs may be difficult or impossible to extract from GIS databases but can be obtained by remote sensing. In the case of forest covertypes, a typical GIS forest inventory database usually will contain information, such as dominant-codominant species descriptions, on a polygonal – or stand – basis. The polygonal structure is usually derived from aerial photointerpretation work, and is suitable for organizing the landscape for many management activities, such as forest harvesting or silviculture operations. However, this polygonal structure may not be as useful in other applications, such as estimating forest growth, especially for small areas and subsets of management units, because of the large local variance (in species or LAI, for example) that can be subsumed within each polygon. Remote sensing methods may be used to determine the variability of the stand species description within each GIS polygon, and this covertype information may be used to improve estimates of forest parameters, such as leaf area index, woody biomass, PAR conversion efficiency and stand respiration, required for ecosystem models and for growth estimation. In this study Landsat TM imagery are classified in the Fundy Model Forest of southeastern New Brunswick to determine forest covertypes and covertype variability within 128 deciduous, coniferous and mixedwood stands which are part of the GIS forest inventory. In earlier work the prediction of stand LAI from Landsat TM imagery was improved with reference to forest inventory information contained in a GIS database; here, an inverse procedure is presented in which the GIS polygon label is augmented with image classification information. The estimates of stand NPP obtained through modelling are improved (by as much as 25%) with reference to the variability of forest covertype from the classification of TM imagery, and the results could be used to identify stands for different management treatments. © 1997, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

The use of models by the scientific community to improve the understanding of the interaction of the incoming radiation (signal) with forest components is increasing. To support these models, an improved method to characterize tree architecture has been developed. This method is designed to reconstruct a statistical three-dimensional image of a complete tree from judicious subsampling of its components. Therefore, a sampling strategy is proposed to gather information (descriptive and spatial) on branches and their segments. A complete vectorization data set involves information on general aspects of the tree, the topology, a set of attributes and details on the foliage. A three-dimensional tree reconstruction procedure integrates the parameters of the vectorization data set for a final branch and tree representation. Spatial variation of foliage throughout the crown is assured by data collection at the segment level. This approach requires no a priori knowledge of a classification scheme for branches and provides local estimates of wood and foliage biomass. Information gathering on branch classes can be decided in the post-processing phase. Results for jack pine data sets are presented. © 1997, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

Microwave data were acquired by the airborne multifrequency radiometer PORTOS (5 GHz, 10.6 GHz, 23.8 GHz, 36.5 GHz, and 90 GHz) over a test site in Les Landes Forest (France). The test site consists of large homogeneous stands of maritime pines (Pinus pinaster). The stands are monospecies and even-aged and cover a large range of age and biomass conditions (the above-ground dry biomass ranges from 0 to about 180 tons/ha). The .stands were flown over twice in May and August 1994. The microwave response to the coniferous stand characteristics is analyzed. A statistical study is carried out to investigate the potential interest of the PORTOS data to discriminate between the different stand categories. The sensitivity of the stand emissivity to view angle, frequency, measurement date, and stand characteristics is analyzed. It is found that the range of forest stand microwave emissivity is relatively narrow for a vegetation coverage exceeding 95%. Although different stand categories can be distinguished from the PORTOS data, the level of discrimination is not sufficient to allow the development of accurate rules of classification. No relationship could be found between low frequency measurements and the stand biovolume. On the other hand, a linear negative relationship is found between emissivity at 10.6 GHz and average tree variables of the stands (age, height, trunk diameter) for well-developed pine stands. Also, potential interest of PORTOS to estimate forest stand characteristics seems to be significant at 90 GHz. For this frequency channel, good correlation is found between emissivity and tree basal area BA. The results presented in this work contribute to better assess the potential applications of the future ESA/MIMR instrument over coniferous areas. © Elsevier Science Inc., 1997.",,"Pinus pinaster; Ecology; Environmental engineering; Microwave devices; Microwave measurement; Microwaves; Monitoring; Radiometry; Remote sensing; Sensitivity analysis; Statistical methods; Coniferous forests; Microwave radiometer; Radiometers; coniferous forest; emissivity; maritime pine; microwave radiometer; microwave radiometry; microwave sensing; pine forest; pine stand; PORTOS; remote sensing; France; Landes; Pinaceae; Pinus pinaster",,,,,,,,,,,,"Wigneron, J.-P.; INRA/Bioclimatologie, 84914 Avignon Cedex 9, France",,"Elsevier Inc.",00344257,,RSEEA,,"English","Remote Sens.

A procedure was developed and tested to divorce the laser and ground data collection efforts using three distinct data seta acquired in and over the tropical forests of Costa Rica. Fixed-area ground plot data were used to simulate the height characteristics of the tropical forest canopy and to simulate laser measurements of that canopy. On two of the three study sites, the airborne laser estimates of basal area, volume, and biomass grossly misrepresented ground estimates of same. On the third study site, where the widest ground plots were utilized, airborne and ground estimates agreed within 24%. Basal area, volume, and biomass prediction inaccuracies in the first two study areas were tied directly to disagreements between simulated laser estimates and the corresponding airborne measurements of average canopy height, height variability, and canopy density. A number of sampling issues were investigated; the following results were noted in the analyses of the three study areas. 1) Of the four ground segment lengths considered (25 m, 50 m, 75 m, and 100 m), the 25 m segment length introduced a level of variability which may severely degrade prediction accuracy in these Costa Rican primary tropical forests. This effect was more pronounced as plot width decreased. A minimum segment length was on the order of 50 m. 2) The decision to transform or not to transform the dependent variable (e.g., biomass) was by far the most important factor of those considered in this experiment. The natural log transformation of the dependent variable increased prediction error, and error increased dramatically at the shorter segment lengths. The most accurate models were multiple linear models with forced zero intercept and an untransformed dependent variable. 3) General linear models were developed to predict basal area, volume, and biomass using airborne laser height measurements. Useful laser measurements include average canopy height, all pulses (h̄a, average canopy height, canopy hits (h̄c and the coefficients of variation of these terms (ca and cc). Coefficients of determination range from 0.4 to 0.6. Based on this research, airborne laser and ground sampling procedures are proposed for use for reconnaissance level surveys of inaccessible forested regions. © Elsevier Science Inc., 1997.",,"Airborne laser sampling; Ground laser sampling; Laser measurements; Tropical forests; Biomass; Environmental engineering; Errors; Mathematical models; Parameter estimation; Remote sensing; Sampling; Spatial variables measurement; Volume measurement; Laser applications; airborne sensing; basal area; biomass; forest volume; laser; tree volume; tropical forest; tropics; Costa Rica",,,,,,,,,,,,"Nelson, R.; Biospheric Sciences Br., , Greenbelt, MD 20771, United States",,"Elsevier Inc.",00344257,,RSEEA,,"English","Remote Sens.

In recent years, increased human impacts have resulted in changes in landscape and structure of the forest ecosystem. The present study is aimed to analyse impacts of disturbance on landscape structure using satellite remote sensing and a geographic information system (GIS) in Madhav National Park of India. The Landsat TM data have been used to identify vegetation types. The patch characteristics of the vegetation like size, shape, porosity and patch density have been studied. The physical and humanmade features have divided the national park in three zones. These zones are also utilised as management zones by the State Forest Department. The study indicates that the central zone is distinctly different from the south and north zones. The patch size and porosity have been found to be most important parameters to discriminate differences in the ecological status of three different zones of the park. The patchiness and shape provide supportive information and characterise the patches of the zones. The structural analysis of the vegetation revealed effect on species diversity and biomass distribution in the different disturbance regimes.","Patch characteristics; Remote sensing; Vegetation structure","ecological analysis; forest landscape; GIS; Landsat Thematic Mapper; Landsat TM; landscape structure; remote sensing; vegetation discrimination; vegetation patch; India, Madhya Pradesh, Madhav National Park",,,,,,,,,,,,"Ravan, S.A.; IGCMC, 172-B, Lodi Estate, N.

Models can provide dynamic estimates through time and can predict the results of changes in forest management practices or changes in the forest ecosystem resulting from natured disturbances. Vegetation and landcover regions identified through unsupervised classification of Global Vegetarian Index (GVI) data provide an appropriate ecosystem and species description for model input parameters. The timing and magnitude of photosynthesis as indicated by NDVI observed from four year average monthly GVI composites were used to identify 42 distinct regions of the former Soviet Union (FSU). These regions represent areas of similar vegetation and land cover at a higher level of spatial detail and with more thorough species description than provided by available continental scale thematic maps. The image classes provide a consistent framework of vegetation and land-cover information across the FSU. Qualitative comparison on a pixel-by-pixel basis with detailed topographic maps and other data showed that, in general, despite the widely acknowledged problems with GVI, surface conditions were well identified by the GVI classification. The image class descriptions for the continental scale analysis required a supplemental description of the species specific to regional ecosystems before they could be used as a forest ecosystem model input parameter. Model predictions for carbon pools in test sites located in the Amur region of Russia compared well to carbon estimates made using other techniques. While GVI-based image classes appear to be appropriate for continental scale analysis, there is still a need to validate the GVI classification approach using higher resolution remote sensing data and field investigations.",,"carbon pool; classification; forest ecosystem; forest ecosystem model; global vegetation index; land cover; modelling; NDVI; vegetation cover; vegetation index; USSR",,,,,,,,,,,,"Gaston, G.G.; U.S. EPA Research Laboratory, 200 SW 35th, Corvallis, OR 97333, United States",,,00991112,,PERSD,,"English","PHOTOGRAMM.

A 15-year fire history (1980 94) was assembled for Kakadu National Park, a 20 000 km2 World Heritage property in monsoonal northern Australia, based on interpretation of LANDSAT MSS imagery sampled at least three times over the 7-month dry season. 2. Detailed ground-truthing was undertaken at the end of the early dry season period (May July) for both 1993 and 1994; ground-truth data were not available for previous years. Overall agreement was greater than 80% in both years. In sum, these data inspire a relatively high degree of confidence in the interpreted fire history of the Park for any one year, at least at the landscape and habitat scales examined here. 3. An average of 46% of the Park was found to be burnt each year over the 15 years of records, with 25% burnt in the early, and 21% burnt in the late, dry season. The data indicate a pronounced shift from a fire regime dominated by late (typically more intense and potentially extensive) dry season fires up until the mid-1980s, to one dominated by early (typically of low intensity and patchy) dry season lites subsequently. 4. Whereas an average of 55% of lowland savanna habitats has been burnt annually, 28% of habitats occupying both sandstone plateau and riverine landforms have been burnt each year. The great majority of burning in relatively fire-sensitive sandstone habitats continues to be in the late dry season. Data indicate a marked increase in the extent of burning on floodplains, and in associated fire-sensitive Melaleuca forests and lowland rainforests, from 1990; this increase is attributed to increased herbaceous fuel loads associated with the removal of feral Asian water buffalo. 5. Proximity analyses indicate that slightly more early dry season burning has been undertaken close to roads, and at greater distances from settlements; no proximity differences were discernible for fires late in the dry season. Burning has been concentrated close to lowland drainage lines, both in the early and late dry season. 6. Lowland savanna sites are burnt on average 3 out of 5 years. In contrast, the majority of sandstone plateau and riverine floodplain sites have burnt on average 0 4 times and 0 3 times, respectively, over the 15 years of records. 7. The median size of contiguously burnt areas (patches) has been declining steadily over the 15 years of records, from upwards of 300 ha initially to c 60 ha in 1994. 8. It is concluded that although the assembled data are imperfect in that they under-represent wet season burns and very small fires, are prone to positional errors of up to c. 300 m, and because little confidence can be placed in the sequential fire histories for any 1-ha site, they afford an effective means by which the Park's fire management programme can be monitored, its problems identified, and its needs assessed. The demonstrable utility of this programme has led to its recent extension on other significant conservation properties in monsoonal northern Australia; the procedure offers potential for wider adoption in savanna regions generally.","Arnhem Land; Burning; Northern Territory; Remote sensing; Savanna","Bubalus; Bubalus bubalis; Melaleuca; Melaleuca; Myrtaceae; biomass burning; fire history; forest management; Landsat MSS; Landsat Thematic Mapper; Landsat TM; prescribed fire; remote sensing; savanna; Australia, Northern Territory, Kakadu National Park",,,,,,,,,,,,"Russell-Smith, J.; BCNT, PO Box 37346, Winnellie, North.

Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) remote sensing imagery, previously published tire history data (Payette et al. 1989), and field observations were used to examine the influence of caribou grazing in part of their lichen-dominated wintering grounds in northern Quebec, Canada. Lichen biomass and percentage ground cover were measured in 1989 and 1992 over a large area (88 150 km2) stratified into live postfire successional stages. 2. Lichen-dominated vegetation covered 55%, moss- or shrub-dominated vegetation 25%, and water bodies 20% of the study area. Lichen biomass increased with postfire stand age, from 530 kg ha-1 in young stands (&lt; 30) years) to 8010 kg ha-1 in old stands (&gt; 90 years). The cumulative amount of lichen cover removed by caribou before 1989 averaged 10% over the study urea: by 1992 this value had risen to 21%. Between 1989 and 1992, ground cover of lichens decreased from 55 to 42%. Lichen removal was concentrated in stands &gt; 50 years old, where it occurred at a rate of about 5% per year. No significant change in lichen cover was observed in younger stands. 3. The number of caribou grazing in the study area between 1989 and 1992 exceeded the carrying capacity estimated from the annual increment in lichen biomass (≃1% year-1); lichens were reduced by both consumption and collateral damage. Lichen cover can be progressively reduced by winter grazing of caribou in large lichen-dominated continental areas in much the same way as in insular ranges. 4. The combination of remote sensed and fire history data may be a helpful tool for managing large herds of wild caribou.","boreal forest; carrying capacity; habitat mapping; Rangifer tarandus; subarctic vegetation","caribou; fire history; grazing; Landsat Thematic Mapper; lichen; Canada, Quebec; Rangifer tarandus",,,,,,,,,,,,"Arseneault, D.; Departement de Biologie, 300 Allee des Ursulines, Rimouski, Que.

Recent studies have demonstrated that synthetic aperture radar (SAR) can be used to estimate above-ground standing biomass. To date, these studies have relied on extensive ground-truth measurements to construct relationships between biomass and SAR backscatter. In this article we discuss the use of models to help develop a relationship between biomass and radar backscatter and compare the predictions with measurements. A gap-type forest succession model was used to simulate growth and development of a northern hardwood-boreal transitional forest typical of central Maine, USA. Model results of species, and bole diameter at breast height (dbh) of individual trees in a 900 m2 stand were used to run discontinuous canopy backscatter models to determine radar backscatter coefficients for a wide range of simulated forest stands. Using model results, relationships of copolarized backscatter to forest biomass were developed and applied to an airborne SAR (AIRSAR) image over a forested area in Maine. A relationship derived totally from model results was found to underestimate biomass. Calibrating the modeled backscatter with limited AIRSAR backscatter measurements improved the biomass estimation when compared to field measurements. The approach of using a combination of forest succession and remote sensing models to develop algorithms for inferring forest attributes produced comparable results with techniques using only measurements. Applying the model derived algorithm to SAR imagery produced reasonable results when mapped biomass was limited to 15 kg/m2 or less.",,"Algorithms; Biomass; Ecosystems; Electromagnetic wave backscattering; Remote sensing; Synthetic aperture radar; Forest biomass; Radar backscatter coefficients; Radar imaging; backscatter; biomass; forest; forest succession; forest succession model; model; radar; radar backscatter model; remote sensing; SAR; succession; USA, Maine","National Aeronautics and Space Administration, NASA: RTOP 462-43; National Research Council, NRC; RTOP 665-31","The work presented in this article was performed at Goddard Space Flight Center and funded by NASA Headquarters Ecosystem Processes and Modeling Program RTOP 462-43 and SIR-C /XSAR Project RTOP 665-31.

Foliage and leaf litter were sampled on 40 plots at Blackhawk Island, Wisconsin, and Harvard Forest, Massachusetts, to determine canopy-level nitrogen and lignin concentrations. At the time of the field sampling, AVIRIS data were acquired for both study areas. Calibration equations were developed, relating nitrogen and lignin to selected first-difference spectral bands (R2 = 0.87 and 0.77, respectively). Calibration equations were evaluated on the basis of inter- and intrasite statistics. These equations were applied to all image pixels to make spatially explicit estimates of canopy nitrogen and lignin for both study sites.

Measurements of tree height, diameter, and species composition were made in 1994 in the Tapajos region of Para State in Brazil in order to estimate the biomass density in 15 widely distributed sample plots. These plots were chosen so as to characterize homogeneous forest areas representing a range of ages of regeneration from new regrowth of mature forest. The mean backscattering coefficients of these forest areas, as measured by SAR instruments on the ERS-1 and JERS-1 satellites and by SIR-C on the Space Shuttle, was determined so that its dependence on the biomass density of regenerating forest at different radar wavelengths and polarizations could be quantified. Results confirm the findings of similar studies of different types of forest, and of radar backscatter models, that the longer wavelength (L-band) SAR imagery may be used to discriminate between different levels of forest biomass up to a certain threshold and that cross polarized backscatter is more sensitive to changes in biomass density. The shorter wavelength (C-band) SAR imagery is limited to differentiating between vegetation and bare soil when it is dry.

As part of this process, a panel of 16 scientists met to review the utility of SAR for monitoring ecosystem processes. The consensus of this ecology panel was that the demonstrated capabilities of imagine radars for investigating terrestrial ecosystems could be best organized into four broad categories: 1) classification and detection of change in land cover; 2) estimation of woody plant biomass; 3) monitoring the extent and timing of inundation; and 4) monitoring other temporally-dynamic processes. The major conclusions from this panel were: 1) Multichannel radar data provide a means to classify land-cover patterns because of its sensitivity to variations in vegetation structure and vegetation and ground-layer moisture. The relative utility of data from imaging radars versus multispectral scanner data has yet to be determined in a rigorous fashion over a wide range of biomes for this application. 2) Imaging radars having the capability to monitor variations in biomass in forested ecosystems. This capability is not consistent among different forest types. The upper levels of sensitivity for L-band and C-band systems such as SIR-C range between &lt;100 t ha-1 for complex tropical forest canopies to ~250 t ha-1 for simpler forests dominated by a single tree species. Best performance for biomass estimation is achieved using lower frequency (P- and L-band) radar systems with a cross-polarized (HV or VH) channel. 3) Like-polarized imaging radars (HH or VV) are well suited for detection of flooding under vegetation canopies. Lower frequency radars (P- and L-band) are most optimal for detecting flooding under forests, whereas higher frequency radars (C-band) work best for wetlands dominated by herbaceous vegetation. 4) It has been shown that spaceborne radars that have been in continuous operation for several years [such as the C-band (VV) ERS-1 SAR] provide information on temporally dynamic processes, such as monitoring a) variations in flooding in nonwooded wetlands, b) changes in the frozen/thawed status of vegetation, and c) relative variations in soil moisture in areas with low amounts of vegetation cover. These observations have been shown to be particularly important in studying ecosystems in high northern latitudes.",,"application review; biiomass estimation; ecology; land cover; monitoring; radar; radar imagery; remote sensing; SAR; Synthetic Aperture Radar; Biomass; Data reduction; Ecology; Ecosystems; Electromagnetic wave polarization; Floods; Moisture; Multispectral scanners; Soils; Synthetic aperture radar; Multichannel radar data; Soil moisture; Tropical forest canopies; Radar imaging",,,,,,,,,,,,"Kasischke, E.S.; School of the Environment, P.O.

It has been applied to a set of diurnal images acquired by the Granada University AVHRR reception system during a severe fire outbreak in Spain (July 1994). The Andalusian Regional Government Environmental Directorate provided the information and boundaries of the fires which are used as 'ground truth' to validate the AVHRR-derived fires boundaries. Both the derived boundaries for the burned area and the fire evolution agree closely with differences ranging from 9% and 20% in the total burnt area. The availability of 24-h field report for one of the fires provided an appropriate test of the continuous monitoring by means of remote sensing technique.

There is a growing demand for availability of data at higher repetivity, at higher spatial resolution, in more and narrower spectral bands etc. Some of the thrust areas of applications particularly in the Indian context are; - Management of natural resources to ensure sustainable increase in agricultural production, - Study the state of the environment, its monitoring and assessment of the impact of. various development actions on the environment, - Updating and generation of large scale topographical maps. - Exploration/exploitation of marine and mineral resources and - Operational meteorology and studying various land and oceanic processes to understand/predict global climate changes. Each of these thrust area of application has many components, related to basic resource areas such as agriculture, forestry, water resources, minerals, marine resources etc. and the field of cartography. Observational requirements for major applications have been summarized as under. Monitoring vegetation health from space remains the most important observational parameter with applications, in agriculture, forestry, environment, hydrology etc. Vegetation extent, quantity and temporal changes are the three main requirements which are not fully realized with RS data available. Vegetation productivity, forest biomass, canopy moisture status, canopy biogeochemistry are some examples. Crop production forecasting is an important application area. Remotely sensed data has been used for identification of crops and their acreage estimation. Fragmented holdings, large spread in crop calendars and different management practices continue to pose a challenge lo remote sensing. Remotely sensed data at much higher spatial resolution than hitherto available as well as at greater repetivity are required to meet this need. Non-availability of cloud-free data in the kharif season is one of the serious problems in operational use of remote sensing for crop inventory. Synthetic aperture radar data al X & Ku bands is necessary to meet this demand. Nutrient stress/disease detection requires observations in narrow spectral bands. In case of forestry applications, multispectral data at high spatial resolution of the order of 5 to 10 metres is required to make working plans at forest compartment level. Observations from space for deriving tree height are required for volume estimation. Observations in the middle infrared region would greatly enhance capability of satellite remote sensing in forest fire detection. Temporal, spatial and spectral observational requirements in various applications on vegetation viewing are diverse, as they address processes at different spatial and time scales. Hence, it would be worthwhile to address this issue in three broad categories. a) Full coverage, moderate spatial resolution with high repetivity (drought, large scale deforestation, forest phenology....). b) Full coverage, moderate to high spatial resolution and high repetivity (crop forecasting, vegetation productivity). c) Selected viewing at high spatial resolution, moderate to high repetivity and with new dimensions to imaging (narrow spectral bands, different viewing angles). A host of agrometeorological parameters are needed to be measured from space for their effective use in development of yield models. Estimation of root-zone soil moisture is an important area requiring radar measurements from space. Surface meteorological observations from space at the desired spatial and temporal distributions has not developed because of heavy demands placed on the sensor as well as analytical operational models. Agrometeorology not only provides quantitative inputs to other applications such as crop forecasting, hydrological models but also could be used for farmer advisory services by local bodies. Mineral exploration requires information on geological structures, geomorphology and lithology. Surface manifestation over localized regions requires large scale mapping while the lithology can be deciphered from specific narrow bands in visible. NIR, MIR and TIR regions. Sensors identified for mapping/cartography in conjunction with imaging spectrometer would seem to cover requirements of this application. Narrow spectral bands in the short regions which provide diagnostics of relevant geological phenomenon are necessary for mineral exploration. Thermal inertia measurements help in better discrimination of different rock units. Measurements from synthetic aperture data which would provide information on geological structures and geomorphology are necessary for mineral exploration. The applications related to marine environment fall in three major areas: (i) Ocean colour and productivity, biological resources; (ii) Land-ocean interface, this includes coastal landforms, bathymetry, littoral transport processes, etc. and; (iii) Physical oceanography, sea surface temperature, winds, wave spectra, energy and mass exchange between atmosphere and ocean. Measurement of chlorophyll concentration accurately on daily basis, sea surface temperature with an accuracy of 0.5 °K. and information on current patterns arc required for developing better fishery forecast models. Improved spatial resolution data are desirable for studying sediment and other coastal processes. Cartography is another important application area. The major problems encountered in relation to topographic map updation are location and geometric accuracy and information content. Two most important requirements for such an application are high spatial resolution data of 1 to 2 metre and stereo capability to provide vertical resolution of 1 metre. This requirement places stringent demands on the sensor specifications, geometric processing, platform stability and automated digital cartography. The requirements for the future earth observation systems based on different application needs can be summarized as follows: • Moderate spatial resolution (l50-300m), high repetivity (2 Days), minimum set of spectral bands (VIS, NIR, MIR. TIR) full coverage. • Moderate to high spatial resolution (20-40m), high repetivity (4-6 Days), spectral bands (VIS, MR, MIR, TIR) full coverage. • High spatial resolution (5-10m) muitispectral data with provision for selecting specific narrow bands (VIS, N1R. MIR), viewing from different angles. • Synthetic aperture radar operating in at least two frequencies (C, X, Ku), two incidence angles/polarizations, moderate to high spatial resolution (20-40m), high repetivity (4-6 Days). • Very high spatial resolution (1-2m) data in panchromatic band to provide terrain details at cadastral level (1:10,000). • Stereo capability (1-2m height resolution) to help planning/execution of development plans. • Moderate resolution sensor operating in VIS, NIR, MIR on a geostationary platform for observations at different sun angles necessary for the development of canopy reflectance inversion models. • Diurnal (at least two i.e. pre-dawn and noon) temperature measurements of the earth surface. • Ocean colour monitor with daily coverage. • Multi-frequency microwave radiometer, scatterometer. altimeter, atmospheric sounder, etc. © 1996 Springer.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Navalgund, R.R.; Space Applications Centre (ISRO), Ahmedabad, 380053, India",,,0255660X,,,,"English","J Indian Soc Remote Sens",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-10844255397

The objective of BOREAS is to improve our understanding of the interaction between the earth's climate system and the boreal forest at short and intermediate time scales, in order to clarify their role in global change. During the winter, spring and summer of 1994, five field campaigns were conducted. About 85 investigation teams including nearly 300 scientists participated, including forest ecologists and ecophysiologists, atmospheric physicists, boundary-layer meteorologists, hydrologists, biochemists, atmospheric chemists and remote sensing specialists. Data from the field campaigns is being placed into a central archive at the Goddard Space Flight Center for immediate access by all participating scientists, and eventually by the outside scientific community. Analysis of the data began in mid-summer as the data were being collected and continues at a rapid pace. The findings so far have been significant in terms of their implications for global change. The boreal ecosystem, occupying roughly 17 percent of the vegetated land surface and thus an important driver of global weather and climate, absorbs much more solar energy than is assumed by operational numerical weather prediction models. Albedo measurements in BOREAS shows that this forest absorbs nearly 91 percent of the sun's incident energy. Additionally, while it is known that much of the boreal ecosystem consists of forested wetlands, numerous lakes, bogs and fens, tower and aircraft measurements during 1994 show that the atmosphere above was extremely dry; humidity and deep boundary layer convection (3000 m) mimicked conditions found only over deserts. Physiological measurements of the trees during BOREAS show that this atmospheric desiccation was a result of the forest's strong biological control limiting surface evaporation. The data further show this tight control was linked to the low soil temperatures and subsequently reduced rates of photosynthesis. BOREAS measurements also focused on net ecosystem carbon exchange. Data acquired during the late spring and summer, showed the boreal forest to be a net carbon sink. However, no measurements were taken in the early spring following thaw, and in the late fall, where the balance between photosynthesis and respiration is poorly understood. During 1996 additional data will be acquired to resolve the annual carbon budget and how it might depend on interannual climate differences.","Boreal ecosystems; BOREAS; Canada; Carbon exchange; Climate change","atmosphere/ecosystem exchange; boreal forest; BOREAS; global change; solar energy; Canada",,,,,,,,,,,,"Hall, F.G.; NASA Goddard Space Flight Center, Greenbelt, MD 20771, United States; email: fghall@ltpmail.gsfc.nasa.gov",,,00375330,,,,"English","Silva Fenn.",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030435895

Consequently, forested environments with high levels of organization are usually characterized by high cover density values and a high degree of spatially homogeneous biomass at the landscape scale. There are however natural or more often anthropic disturbances which tend to oppose this trend. Because forest structure is a spatial phenomenon, quantitative measures of spatial heterogeneity are a useful means of increasing our understanding of landscape structure and dynamics. The primary objective of this study, which uses remotely sensed inputs of plant biomass, was to describe the processes that generate heterogeneity within a forested mountainous landscape of Central Italy at the scale of Landsat TM data with a simplified texture algorithm.

These patterns are detected and mapped using satellite data. Other ecological information can be abstracted from satellite data regarding rates of recovery of vegetation foliage and variation of burn severity on different vegetation types. Middle infrared wavelengths are useful for burn severity mapping because the land cover changes associated with burning increase reflectance in this part of the electromagnetic spectrum. Simple stratification of Landsat Thematic Mapper data define varying classes of burn severity because of changes in canopy cover, biomass removal, and soil chemical composition. Reasonable maps of burn severity are produced when the class limits of burn severity reflectance are applied to the entire satellite data. Changes in satellite reflectance over multiple years reveal the dynamics of vegetation and fire severity as low burn areas have lower changes in reflectance relative to high burn areas. This results as a consequence of how much the site was altered due to the burn and how much space is available for vegetation recovery. Analysis of change in reflectance across steppe, riparian, and forested vegetation types indicate that fires potentially increase biomass in steppe areas, while riparian and forested areas are slower to regrow to pre-fire conditions. This satellite-based technology is useful for mapping severely burned areas by exploring the ecological manifestations before and after fire.","Burn severity; Classification; Glacier National Park; Landsat Thematic Mapper; Reflectance; Vegetation recovery",,,,,,,,,,,,,"White, J.D.; Numer.

The measurements of biomass per unit area and productivity have been set as one of the goals for International Geosphere-Biosphere Programme (IGBP). Ground assessment of biomass, however, has been found insufficient to present spatial extent of the biomass. The present study suggests approaches for using satellite remote sensing data for regional biomass mapping in Madhav National Park (MP). The stratified random sampling in the homogeneous vegetation strata mapped using satellite remote sensing has been effectively utilized to extrapolate the sample point biomass observations in the first approach. In the second approach attempt has been to develop empirical models with satellite measured spectral response and biomass. The results indicate that there is significant relationships with spectral responses. These relationships have seasonal dependency in varying phenological conditions. The relationships are strongest in visible bands and middle infrared bands. However, spectral biomass models developed using middle infrared bands would be more reliable as compared to the visible bands as the later spectral regions are less sensitive to atmospheric changes. It was observed that brightness and wetness parameters show very strong relationship with the biomass values. Multiple regression equations using brightness and wetness isolates have been used to predict biomass values. The model used has correlation coefficient of 0·77. Per cent error between observed and predicted biomass was 10·5%. The biomass estimated for the entire national park using stratified and spectral response modelling approaches were compared and showed similarity with the difference of only 4·69%.

Of Geography, University of Regina, Regina, SK, S4S OA2, Canada","Forestry is an active area of remote sensing reserch in Canada and elsewhere. Two aspects of performing forest inventories, mapping species distribution and estimating foliar biomass, have well established remote sensing techniques. However, estimating the woody biomass component of a given forest stand commonly relies upon manual methods and little effort has been directed towards developing a digital procedure. Foresters prefer information on the structural characteristics of the forest along with species information, rather than foliar biomass information. Recent research suggests a relationship between synthetic aperture radar and structural characteristics of the forest such as tree height and crown diameter. When combined with optical data, these two information sources can more completely describe forest conditions which can assist in forest management by providing an economical and timely method to measure and monitor large forested areas such as those found in Canada. Convair-580 C-band, HV and VV polarization were collected in the Blue Ridge Lumber Forest Management Area just north of Whitecourt, Alberta in 1989. The present study examines the relation between forest structure of two coniferous species and various tone and texture measures derived from SAR data. An attempt to classify 24 pine and 44 spruce stands into Alberta Vegetation Inventory height classes, using SAR derivatives, produced results over 70% which approaches accuracies obtained using manual methods. Stepwise regression is used to estimate the actual mean tree heights for the same 24 pine and 44 spruce stands. Results of this analysis indicate a strong relation between the SAR data and canopy roughness as controlled by tree size and an inverse relation with tree density. With the recent launch of RADARSAT, it is a priority to develop successful and practical applications of SAR data for forestry and other areas. This will permit better management practices and will ensure the success of the RADARSAT program. © 1996, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

Data were acquired in early and late spring, summer, fall and winter, to emphasize the pronounced seasonal variability experienced in the boreal forest. Comprehensive field measurements were obtained for 93 mature test stands, which were subsequently stratified into three classes (spruce, pine, and aspen-dominated hardwood) based on the dominant stand species. Meteorological observations were obtained from two automated stations deployed in the test area throughout the data acquisition phase. As a result of the analysis of this data set, we have determined that the backscatter dynamic range in the boreal forest shows a pronounced seasonal cycle. For the species studied, and for all dates, the dynamic range is usually less than four dB in like polarization and six dB in cross polarization. The dynamic range is largest during the spring and fall, and smallest during summer and winter. The backscatter from spruce is greater than from pine, but the difference becomes very small in summer and winter. The backscatter from hardwoods is greater than that from the conifers except in the summer, when it is essentially the same. These seasonal changes make it feasible to use multi-date C-band backscatter observations to discriminate these important boreal forest cover types. Discrimination with single-date, multiple polarization data was comparable to discrimination with multi-date, single-polarization data. Discrimination was poor (generally less than 80%) with all single-date, single-polarization images. Using single and multiple regression techniques, this large data set was exhaustively tested for relationships between C-band backscatter and stand structure measures, including crown closure, mean diameter-at-breast-height, mean tree height, mean crown closure, mean age, stems/hectare, timber volume/hectare, and biomass per hectare. Several weak relationships were found but none were strong enough to suggest that C-band backscatter might be capable of providing reliable estimates of stand structural parameters. Species composition is identified as the most important influence driving backscatter differences in C-band SAR images of the mature boreal forest. © 1996, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

Techniques for crop discrimination and mapping have made such rapid progress that we can classify crop types with more than 80% accuracy. The estimation of crop biomass using satellite data, including leaf area, dry and fresh weights, and the prediction of grain yield, has been attempted using various spectral vegetation indices. Plant stresses caused by nutrient deficiency and water deficit have also been analysed successfully. Such information may be useful for farm management. In the latter half of the paper, we introduce the Arctic Science Project, which was carried out under the Science and Technology Agency of Japan collaborating with Finnish scientists. In this project, monitoring of the boreal forest was carried out using LANDSAT data. Changes in the phenology of subarctic ground vegetation, based on spectral properties, were measured by a boom-mounted, four-band spectroradiometer.

Two fresh leaf and one dry leaf datasets containing a broad range of native and cultivated plant species were examined using unconstrainied stepwise multiple linear regression and constrained regression with wavelengths reported from other leaf level studies and wavelengths derived from chemical spectroscopy. Although stepwise multiple linear regression explained large amounts of the variation in the chemical data, the bands selected were not related to known absorption bauds, varied among datasets and expression bases for the chemical [concentration (g g-1) or content (g m-2)], did not correspond to bands selected in other studies, and were sensitive to the samples entered into the regression. Stepwise multiple regression using artificially constucted datasets that randomized the association between nitrogen concentration and reflectance spectra produced coefficients of determination (R2's) between 0.41 and 0.82 for first and second derivative lag(1/R) spectra. The R2's for correctly-paired nitrogen data and first and second derivative log(1/R) only exceeded the average randomized R2's by 0.02- 0.42.

There were significantly less lichens, especially Cladina stellaris, at grazed than at ungrazed sites. Coverage of other lichens like C. arbuscula and C. rangiferina and bryophytes, especially Dicranum spp., benefitted from grazing. The biomass of vascular plants, mainly Calluna vulgaris, Empetrum nigrum and Vaccinium vitis-idaea, was reduced at grazed sites, although their coverage was not influenced. Microbial activity was significantly lower at grazed sites. The influence of grazing is most obviously mediated by reduced soil moisture during dry periods at grazed sites. Fine root parameters (per soil and stem volumes) were lower at grazed sites (pPCA = 0.072), the first principal component consisting of a number of fine root tips, length and weight. Grazing decreased all exchangeable nutrients by 30-60% in organic layer. Based on PCA the decrease was significant for exchangeable nutrients, although of individual elements only P and S showed statistically significant difference.

The range of the semivariograms was 5 m. for Scots pine and 7 m for Norway spruce. Range is also weakly dependent on forest age class. Thereafter sill was found to be strongly dependent on tree species and forest age class. The local variance maximum in infrared and green band was obtained with a spatial resolution of 3 m and in red channel with a resolution of 2 m. Like the semivariance the local variance was at a higher level in spruce and old forests. © 1996 Taylor & Francis Ltd.",,"Biomass; Correlation methods; Forestry; Light; Optical resolving power; Photography; Plants (botany); Norway spruce; Scots pine; Semivariograms; Remote sensing; boreal forest; forest age; pixel; remote sensing; semivariogram; spatial autocorrelation; spatial resolution; tree species; variance curve",,"Acknowledgments This study was funded by the Finnish Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, by research project 'Remote Sensing as a Data Source for Detailed Forest Information'.

These spectra exhibit enhanced CO column densities at the same geographic locations over the smoke plume on both over-flights with a peak CO column density ∼ 2.6 × 1018 cm-2, ∼ 6σ above the clear air background. Meteorological conditions suggest the smoke plume was confined to the planetary boundary layer (PEL), pressures ≥ 850 mb, and perhaps to a thin region near the top of the PEL. Constraining the excess CO to the PEL yields a CO mixing ratio ∼ 1,400 ppbv. Further constraining the CO to the model layer nearest the top of the PEL, 852-878 mb, yields ∼ 4,300 ppbv. From the spatial overlap of the spectra, the estimated width of the CO rich portion of the plume is ≤ 2.8 km vs. a plume width of ∼ 5 km in GOES-8 satellite visible images.

The electromagnetic scattering and radar processing, which produce the INSAR observations, are modeled, vegetation and topographic parameters are identified for estimation, the parameter errors are assessed in terms of INSAR instrumental performance, and the parameter estimation is demonstrated on INSAR data and compared to ground truth. The fundamental observations from which vegetation and surface topographic parameters are estimated are (1) the cross-correlation amplitude, (2) the cross-correlation phase, and (3) the synthetic aperture radar (SAR) backscattered power. A calculation based on scattering from vegetation treated as a random medium, including the effects of refractivity and absorption in the vegetation, yields expressions for the complex cross correlation and backscattered power in terms of vegetation characteristics. These expressions lead to the identification of a minimal set of four parameters describing the vegetation and surface topography: (1) the vegetation layer depth, (2) the vegetation extinction coefficient (power loss per unit length), (3) a parameter involving the product of the average backscattering amplitude and scatterer number density, and (4) the height of the underlying ground surface. The accuracy of vegetation and ground surface parameters, as a function of INSAR observation accuracy, is evaluated for aircraft INSAR, which is characterized by a 2.5-m baseline, an altitude of about 8 km, and a wavelength of 5.6 cm. It is found that for ≈0.5% accuracy in the INSAR normalized cross-correlation amplitude and ≈5° accuracy in the interferometric phase, few-meter vegetation layer depths and ground surface heights can be determined from INSAR for many types of vegetation layers. With the same observational accuracies, extinction coefficients can be estimated at the 0.1-dB/m level. Because the number of parameters exceeds the number of observations for current INSAR data sets, external extinction coefficient data are used to demonstrate the estimation of the vegetation layer depth and ground surface height from INSAR data taken at the Bonanza Creek Experimental Forest in Alaska. This demonstration shows approximately 5-m average ground truth agreement for vegetation layer depths and ground-surface heights, with a clear dependence of error on stand height. These errors suggest refinements in INSAR data acquisition and analysis techniques which will potentially yield few-meter accuracies. The information in the INSAR parameters is applicable to a variety of ecological modeling issues including the successional modeling of forested ecosystems.",,"Biomass; Electromagnetic wave attenuation; Electromagnetic wave scattering; Natural resources exploration; Plants (botany); Signal processing; Synthetic aperture radar; Data acquisition; Ecology; Errors; Forestry; Interferometry; Parameter estimation; Radar; Surface topography; Synthetic aperture radar; Topography; Vegetation; Underlying topography; Vegetation characteristics; Remote sensing; Fighter aircraft; Backscattering amplitude; Ecological modeling; Electromagnetic scattering; Extinction coefficients; Interferometric phase; Interferometric radars; Interferometric synthetic aperture radars; Normalized cross correlation",,,,,,,,,,,,"Treuhaft, R.N.; Jet Propulsion Laboratory, 4800 Oak Grove Drive, Pasadena, CA 91109-8099, United States; email: bob_treuhaft@radar-email.jpl.nasa.gov",,"American Geophysical Union",00486604,,RASCA,,"English","Radio Sci",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030290179

Understanding the changes of forest fragmentation through time are important for assessing alterations in ecosystem processes (forest productivity, species diversity, nutrient cycling, carbon flux, hydrology, spread of pests, etc.) and wildlife habitat and populations. The study area was the H.J. Andrews Experimental Forest on the Blue River Ranger District of the Willamette National Forest in western Oregon. Timber harvesting has occurred in this forest over the past 45 years and has a recorded forest management history. The study area was extracted from a georeferenced TM scene acquired on 7 July 1991. A coincident digital terrain model (DTM) derived from digital topographic elevation data was also acquired. Using this DTM and an image processing software package, slope and aspect images were generated over the study area. Sites were chosen to cover the entire range of forest stand age and slope and aspect. The oldest recorded clearcut stands were logged in 1950. A number of sites were chosen as primary forest which had no recorded history of cutting. Various feed-forward neural networks trained with back propagation were tested to predict forest age from TM data and topographic data. The results demonstrated that neural networks can be used as an initial model for inferring forest age. The best network was a 6 → 5 → 1 structure with inputs of TM Bands 3, 4, and 5, elevation, slope and aspect. The rms values of the predicted forests age were on the order of 5 years. TM Bands 1, 2, 6, and 7 did not significantly add information to the network for learning forest age. Furthermore, the results suggests that topographic information (elevation, slope, and aspects) can be effectively utilized by a neural network approach. The results of the network approach were significantly better than corresponding linear systems.",,"back propagation; DTM; forest age; Landsat TM; neural network; remote sensing; topographic information; USA, Oregon, Willamette National Forest, Blue River Ranger District; Backpropagation; Computer simulation; Computer software; Ecosystems; Environmental engineering; Feature extraction; Feedforward neural networks; Image processing; Neural networks; Digital terrain model; Forest age; Thematic mapper; Topographic data; Remote sensing",,,,,,,,,,,,"Kimes, D.S.; Biospheric Sciences Br., , Greenbelt, MD 20771, United States",,"Elsevier Inc.",00344257,,RSEEA,,"English","REMOTE SENS.

Ten spectrally defined forest cover types were created from unsupervised classification of the Landsat TM data, using a geographic information system to restrict data analysis to areas of similar slope, elevation, and surficial geology within the Central Plateau region of the park. Biotic data on fittest overstory and understory conditions were collected from 69 sample sites within the 10 spectral cover classes. Field data were used to regroup the 69 sites into six biotically and spectrally distinct cover types, ranging from early postfire regeneration (LPO) to late-stage (LP3) subalpine fir succession, increased absorption in the visible (TM 1, 2, and 3) and middle-infrared (TM 5 and 7) bands were related to the age and development of a stand. Changes in absorption were rapid during the initial stages of stand regeneration, but the rate of change slowed as stands progressed into later successional stages. Biotic factors relating to the physical structure of the forest canopy (height, basal area, biomass, and LAI) are correlated with the visible and middle-infrared bands of the Thematic Mapper. Understory factors were poorly correlated with spectral response, except soil and fireweed, which are dominant early in succession, but rapidly decrease in later stages. The spectral reflectance of a successional forest stand over time is a function of the combined effects of the overs tory canopy, the amount of shadow within a canopy, and the condition of the forest understory. As a forest develops from a disturbance to old-growth, the spectral response of a stand progresses along a vector or vectors linking the three factors. Spectral response changes are nonlinear with respect to time, as large-magnitude changes are observed in the first 20-30 years following a disturbance, and the rate of change lessens as forests develop into old-growth.",,"biophysical factor; forest; lodgepole pine; spectral reflectance; USA, Wyoming, Yellowstone National Park; Pinus contorta latifolia; Absorption; Characterization; Data reduction; Environmental engineering; Geographic information systems; Geographical regions; Mapping; Spectral reflectance; Spectral response; Thematic mapper; Remote sensing","National Aeronautics and Space Administration: NASA NGT-30062; University of Wyoming","This research was supported by a National Aeronautics and Space Administration Global Climate Change Fellowship (NASA NGT-30062) and a grant from the University of Wyoming/ National Parks Service Research Center.

Regeneration of forest on previously cleared areas, however, is a significant carbon sink. The strength of this carbon sink is dependent on the age and composition of the regenerating forest. The ability to identify regenerating forest classes that may differ in terms of carbon sink strength was investigated with Landsat TM data of a test site near Manaus, Brazil A number of forest age classes were defined from a time series of Landsat sensor data, and their separability in Landsat TM data was assessed by maximum likelihood classifications. A high level of class separability was observed with a weighted kappa coefficient of 0.8569 obtained for a classification of six forest regeneration classes. Of the classification errors observed most were found to be associated with the youngest forest age class. At the test site, however, two main successional pathways were followed and the differences between areas of forest of the same age but on different pathways was most apparent with the youngest forests. Splitting the regenerating forests by the successional pathway was found to increase classification accuracy, with a weighted kappa coefficient of 0.9315 observed for an 11 class classification. A range of tropical forest classes that vary in strength as a carbon sink could therefore be identified accurately from Landsat TM data. Although the broader generality of the results requires further investigation, this indicates the potential to use image classifications to scale-up point measurements of the carbon flux between regenerating forest classes and the atmosphere over large areas.",,"carbon sink; classification; forest regeneration; Landsat TM data; tropical forest; Brazil, Amazonas, Manaus","Natural Environment Research Council, NERC: GST / 02 / 604","The authors acknowledge the financial support provided by the Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) through its Terrestrial Initiative Global Environmental Research (TIGER) programme, Award GST / 02 / 604.

Sites of mature forest, agriculture, pasture, pasture with remnant trees, and stands of secondary forest regrowth from 2 to 19 years of age were surveyed in two study areas near Manaus, Amazonas, Brazil, and mapped to the TM imagery. Considerable changes in spectral reflectance were observed over the first 19 years of regrowth, and these can be summarized by indices related to canopy brightness and greenness. The near-infrared reflectance, the difference index, Kauth-Thomas greenness, and percentage leaf cover all increase over the first 4 years after abandonment, peak from 4 to 8 years, and decrease from 8 to 13 years. The Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) rapidly rises over the first 4 years, and displays no apparent relation to stand age thereafter. The brightness of regrowth canopies decreases from 8 to 13 years. Stands from 13 to 19 years-old are spectrally similar to mature forest. All regrowth age classes are spectrally distinct from agriculture and pasture, and all regrowth age classes younger than 14 years are spectrally distinct from mature forest. Spectral indices of canopy brightness are significantly correlated with regrowth stand age (r 2≤0·48, p&lt;0·001). Based on field research in several areas of Amazonia, these spectral patterns can be explained in terms of temporal changes in canopy geometry and leaf area. The estimated rates of regrowth clearance and reversion to regrowth between 1988 and 1991 suggest the intensity of rotational agriculture practised by both communities. These results suggest that monitoring tropical secondary regrowth with TM imagery could substantially improve estimates of carbon sequestration subsequent to tropical deforestation. © 1996, Taylor &amp; Francis Group, LLC.

Such regeneration stages can be characterized by biophysical properties, such as leaf and wood biomass, which influence the radiance emitted and/or reflected from the forest canopy. Remotely sensed data can therefore be used to estimate these biophysical properties and thereby determine the forest regenerative stage. Studies conducted on temperate forests have related biophysical properties successfully with red and near-infrared radiance, particularly within the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI). However, only weak correlations have generally been observed for tropical forests and it is suggested here that the relationship between forest biophysical properties and middle and thermal infrared radiance may be stronger than that between those properties and visible and near-infrared radiance. An assessment of Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) data revealed that radiance acquired in middle and thermal infrared wavebands contained significant information for the detection of regeneration stages in Amazonian tropical forests. It was demonstrated that tropical forest regeneration stages were most separable using middle infrared and thermal infrared wavebands and that the correlation with regeneration stage was stronger with middle infrared, thermal infrared or combinations of these wavebands than they were with visible, near infrared or combinations of these wavebands. For example, correlation coefficients increased from — 0·26 (insignificant at 95 per cent confidence level) when using the NDVI, to up to 0·93 (significant at 99 per cent confidence level) for a vegetation index containing data acquired in the middle and thermal infrared wavebands. These results point to the value of using data acquired in middle and thermal infrared wavebands for the study of tropical forests. © 1996 Taylor And Francis Ltd.",,"forest regeneration; Landsat Thematic Mapper; NDVI; radiance; rainforest; regeneration; remote sensing; TM data; tropical forest; vegetation index; South America, Amazonia",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,01431161,,,,"English","Int.

The fitted phenology models were used in a simplified canopy radiative transfer model to estimate the amount of incident photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) intercepted annually. The relationship between annual estimated PAR interception (IPAR) and measured annual above-ground net primary production (AANPP), that is, the dry matter yield of ΣIPAR (εi) was examined. Annual PAR interception among aspen stands was relatively high (600-1100 MJ m-2 yr-1), with just three stands intercepting less than 600 MJ m-2 yr-1. Stand age affected the relationship between ΣIPAR and AANPP in aspen, with ΣIPAR in young stands being strongly related to AANPP (r2 = 0.77, p &lt; 0.002) yet weakly related in mature stands (r2 = 0.18, p &lt; 0.05). This observation is consistent with increased maintenance respiration demands as the ratio of total to foliar biomass increases with stand age. εi for above-ground production in aspen stands varied from 0.44-1.29 gMJ-1, averaging 0.92 (±0.22) g MJ-1. In spruce, ΣIPAR varied widely among stands (100-1100 MJ m-2), regardless of age, and explained 76% of the variance in AANPP (p &lt; 0.0001). εi for above-ground production in spruce varied from 0.17-0.89 g MJ-1, averaging 0.49 (±0.17) gMJ-1. These values are within the range reported for other forest ecosystems. Estimates of AANPP from ΣIPAR, assuming median values of εi were used to estimate a carbon drawdown of 256 Mg C km-2 for the above-ground component of general ecosystem cover-types over the 2280 km2 study area. Variability in εi among forest stands, both within and between species, is discussed in the context of evolutionary optimization of resource use efficiency. Results suggest that factors in addition to light interception are required to estimate stand productivity in boreal forest ecosystems, particularly in stands that are subject to periodic moisture stress and increased respiration demands with age. © 1996 Elsevier Science B.V.

Therefore accurate estimation and monitoring of land cover changes is important in global change research. Although, land cover has dramatically changed over the last few centuries, until now there has been no consistent way of quantifying the changes globally. In this study we used long-term climate, soils data along with coarse resolution satellite observations to quantify the magnitude and spatial extent of global land cover changes due to anthropogenic processes. Differences between potential leaf area index, derived from climate-soil-leaf area equilibrium and actual leaf area index obtained from satellite data were used to estimate changes in land cover. Forest clearing for agriculture and irrigated farming in arid and semi-arid lands are found to be two major sources of climatically important land cover changes. Satellite derived Spectral Vegetation indices (SV I) and surface temperatures (T s) show strong impact of land cover changes on climatic processes. Irrigated agriculture in dry areas increased energy absorption and evapotranspiration (ET) compared to natural vegetation. On the other hand, forest clearing for crops decreased energy absorption and ET. A land cover classification and monitoring system is proposed using satellite derived SV I and T s that simultaneously characterize energy absorption and exchange processes. This completely remote sensing based approach is useful for monitoring land cover changes as well as their impacts on climate. Monitoring the spatio-temporal dynamics of land cover is possible with current operational satellites, and could be substantially improved with the Earth Observing System (EOS) era satellite sensors. © 1995 Kluwer Academic Publishers.",,"climatic process; land clasification; land cover; leaf area index; satellite data; vegetation index",,,,,,,,,,,,"Nemani, R.R.; School of Forestry, , Missoula, 59812, MT, United States",,"Kluwer Academic Publishers",01650009,,CLCHD,,"English","Clim.

In order to accurately estimate the active fire distribution in the function of different sorts of West African savannas (Sahelian, Sudanian and Guinean) and forests, a multispectral methodology has been developed based on NOAA/11-AVHRR satellite data, with the purpose of eliminating as much as possible the problems related to large surface heterogeneity, confusion and bias, produced by clouds, smoke, haze, background emissivities, etc. Unlike other methods, the results show that the multispectral method, in spite of its selectivity, provides realistic results, and does not under- or over-estimate the number of fires that can be sensed by the satellite.

Parameters related to photosynthetic function were similar for bark and leaves: chlorophyll (Chl) concentration; fluorescence responses; and spectral reflectance. Similar increases along a vertical gradient from base to tree top were observed for incident photosynthetically active radiation (PAR), photosynthetic pigment content, photosynthetic capacity, and spectral reflectance variables. Since transmittance of aspen bark periderm was 20-30% in the blue, and 50-60% in the red Chl absorption bands, the PAR available to the photosynthetic cortical layer in the natural, canopy environment (&lt;1000 μmol m-2 s-1) was sufficient to support positive net assimilation (&lt;8-10 νmol CO2 m-2 s-1) under ideal conditions (e.g., light, temperature, saturating CO2), a rate approximately 30-50% that of leaves. However, the respiring tissues comprising the greater fraction of bark tissue bias the balance of CO2 exchange in favour of respiration for the whole bark. Therefore, net photosynthesis under ambient conditions on the whole bark was, in general, negative. The total bark surface area was estimated to contain 17-40% of the whole tree Chl. The contribution of the bark surface area fraction of the full canopy (leaves plus bark) increased with age (&lt;60 years), with a similar trend expected for bark in total tree (and stand) photosynthesis. A spectral reflectance variable, the red edge inflection point (REIP), was related to total bark Chl content (r2=0.74). A better predictive relationship (r2=0.82) for total bark Chl was observed using a spectral index calculated from the reflectance ratio of two narrow wavebands (R3/R2: R2 and R3 are between 0.715-0.726 μm and 0.734-0.747 μm, respectively), which may have greater utility in landscape remote sensing.

The sites extend across an ecoclimatic transect through the boreal forest of central Canada, from aspen parkland to sub-arctic woodland. Sites were selected using satellite, air photograph, and forest cover map data. Each site represents a minimum 100 m by 100 m homogeneous stand, suitable for satellite imaging. Data collected at each site covers overstory (species composition, DBH, pathogens, age, etc.), understory (percent cover by species), debris, and soil characteristics. These data provide a background database for the diverse measurements of terrestrial ecology, land surface climatology, tropospheric chemistry, and remote sensing. Such data provide an important baseline for ongoing studies of the boreal forest in a region sensitive to global change. The results of this study aid integration of a variety of more detailed studies being carried out in the region and also allow comparison with other international studies of a similar nature. Sites are concentrated in two regions: north of Prince Albert, Saskatchewan, and west of Thompson, Manitoba. Additional sites are located in the area of the Boreal Forest Transect Case Study (BFTCS) between Batoche, Saskatchewan and Gillam, Manitoba. The surveyed sites were classified according to three criteria: dominant species (Picea mariana, Populus tremuloides, Pinus banksiana, or ""mixed""), age (mature, immature, or young/recently disturbed), and productivity (low, medium, or high). Overstory and understory measurements were usually taken at three points within each site. Debris measurements were taken at two points, and soil measurements at one point per site. This paper focuses on overstory and debris data taken at 97 sites in 1993 and 1994. The sites are predominantly in medium and high productivity stands. Overstoiy. data, primarily from point-sampling, have been used to estimate stand basal areas, stem densities, volumes, and aboveground biomass (excluding foliage). Stand basal areas ranged from 5 m2 ha-1 to over 60 m2 ha-1. Stem densities ranged from a few hundred to over 40 000 stem ha-1. Estimates of total aboveground biomass range from a few Mg ha-1 to over 250 Mg ha-1. The Prince Albert sites tend to have greater values than Thompson for basal area, volume and biomass, but stem densities are highly variable. Detritus data show values from zero to 60 Mg ha-1. Generally, these values are small compared to aboveground biomass, but in recently disturbed sites the detrital mass can exceed aboveground biomass. © 1995 Kluwer Academic Publishers.","biomass; boreal Forest; detritus; field methods; overstory","biomass; boreal forest; transect; Canada, Manitoba; Canada, Saskatchewan; Biomass; Chemistry; Climatology; Data acquisition; Database systems; Ecosystems; Imaging techniques; Photography; Plants (botany); Remote sensing; Soils; Boreal forests; Detritus; Overstory; Tropospheric chemistry; Understory; Ecology; biomass; canada; conference paper; forest; forestry; nonhuman; technique; Boreas; Paragnetina; Picea mariana; Pinus banksiana; Populus tremuloides",,,,,,,,,,,,"Halliwell, D.H.; Canadian Forest Service, 5320-122 St., Edmonton, T6H 3S5, Alberta, Canada",,"Kluwer Academic Publishers",00496979,,WAPLA,,"English","Water Air Soil Pollut",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0028991373

This approach, based on control theory, postulates that errors in model parameters or initial states can be corrected, by minimizing the differences between satellite observations and modelled reflectances. These reflectances are computed from model state variables, (carbon in the leaves) with a direct “scene” model. The differences between this approach and previous studies dealing with the coupling of satellite data and vegetation modelling are briefly discussed. A synthetic experiment with a generic vegetation model, designed for carbon cycle investigations, shows that processes such as allocation of carbon to the leaves and phenological behavior of a deciduous‐forest canopy can be controlled, and that carbon exchanges estimation can then be improved. Furthermore, we show that assimilation of real satellite observations in a crop model leads to improved simulation of vegetation functioning, as ground‐truth information confirms that a good retrieval of the sowing date, the control parameter, is achieved. Finally, we point out the interests and requisites for application to natural vegetation carbon fluxes estimations at the global scale. Copyright © 1995, Wiley Blackwell.

Multifrequency and multipolarization image data were made available during the SRL-1 (Apr. 10, 1994) and SRL-2 (Oct. 1, 1994) missions. These image data sets were analyzed and maps of forest cover type and above ground woody dry biomass were generated. A portion of the Southern Study Area of the Boreal Ecosystem-Atmosphere Study (BOREAS) was mapped for forest cover type with classification accuracies on the order of 80%. Maps of estimated biomass were also produced that match observed patterns and preliminary ground data. The upper limit of sensitivity of the radar to boreal forest biomass in our study area was about 20 kg/m2 or 200 tons/ha. The highest average observed biomass in our ground measurements was about 25 kg/m2. Highest sensitivity of the radar to biomass was attained using April backscatter data and a ratio of L-band HV to C-band HV. Results show that radar estimates of biomass were within ±2 kg/m2 at the 95% confidence level. A comparison of the April and October data sets was conducted to understand the effects of seasons on the analysis. It appears that the frozen trees and wetter background contributes to increased backscattering observed in the April data. These early results indicate that multiple polarization and multiple frequency SAR data can be used to monitor and map northern forest biomes. © 1995 IEEE",,"Algorithms; Biomass; Data processing; Ecosystems; Electromagnetic wave backscattering; Mapping; Mathematical models; Monitoring; Remote sensing; Synthetic aperture radar; Boreal forest biomass; Multiple frequency; Multiple polarization; Spaceborne imaging radar-C; Radar imaging","RTOP 462-33, RTOP 462-62; National Aeronautics and Space Administration, NASA: RTOP 665-31","Manuscript received December 8, 1994; revised March 16, 1995.

A growing body of research has shown a significant radar backscatter response to biomass in a variety of forest systems. Alaskan boreal forests may be well suited to radar remote sensing. The sites selected represent black spruce (Picea mariana) and white spruce (Picea glauca) stands in a post-fire chronosequence. Black spruce biomass ranged from less than 1 kg/m2 to 5.6 kg/m2 and white spruce from 8.8 to 21.5 kg/m2. Results indicate both ERS-1 and JERS-1 backscatter is responsive to biomass, density, and height, though other factors, principally surface moisture conditions, are often a stronger influence. Sensitivity to forest biomass and structure appears greatest when surface moisture conditions are minimized as a factor. Biomass correlations with the radar backscatter were strongest in the late winter imagery when all sites had a snow cover, and late summer when the surface is most dry. ERS-1 data may be more sensitive to surface moisture conditions than the JERS-1 data due to the shorter wavelength of the C-band sensor, though this is inconclusive because of limited JERS-1 L-band data for comparison. Also, though the ERS-1 platform has proved to provide a very stable signal, results must be interpreted with caution as the dynamic range for our study sites is often less than 4 dB, and the uncertainty of the backscatter estimate is ±1.5 dB. © 1995.",,"biomass; boreal forest; ERS-1; JERS-1; radar backscatter; stand structure; surface moisture; Alaska","National Aeronautics and Space Administration, NASA: NAGW-2645","This research was funded by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration under Grant No. NAGW-2645 to the Environmental Research Institute of Michigan and Grant No.",,,,,,,,,,"Harrell, P.A.; School of the Environment, Duke University, Durham, NC, United States",,,00344257,,RSEEA,,"English","Remote Sens.

Because of its large area of high C density forests and high deforestation rate, Brazil may play an important role in the global C cycle. The study reported here developed an annual C budget for Brazil for the year 1990. The budget was based on a simple conceptual model of ecosystem C storage and flux, a newly developed vegetation map based on remote sensing data, and published information on carbon densities and flux parameters. The analysis presents an estimate of net anthropogenic flux from land use change and includes an estimate of C accumulation in secondary forests. Net CO2C emission estimates ranged from 174 × 106 to 233 × 106 Mg C year-1. Timber harvest in plantations and burning fossil fuels contributed additional emissions of about 107 × 106 Mg C year-1.

These exchanges affect local, regional, and global climates, which feedback to affect the biogeography and physiology of the vegetation. Consequently, there is interest in developing a comprehensive land surface scheme that integrates bio-physical, biogeochernical, and ecosystem dynamical processes. Land surface process models of energy and moisture exchanges, ecosystem biogeochemistry models, and ecosystem dynamics models share many features. However, these models have been developed independently by groups interested in their respective field not in the integration across fields. Thus, there are important discrepancies among models that will have to be reconciled if an integrative land-atmosphere interaction package is to be developed. In particular, the temporal resolution and biophysical rigor of land surface process models and the links among energy, water, and C02 exchange make these models the logical model to calculate land-atmosphere CO2 exchange at diurnal to annual time scales. Longer-term exchanges can be simulated by including plant demography and nutrient cycling. Models that combine the biophysical and biogeochemical controls of C02 exchange help define remote sensing applications important to modeling the seasonal and annual carbon balance of terrestrial ecosystems. Sensitivity analyses with such a model show that the annual production of biomass and the seasonal cycle of C02 exchange in boreal forests are well approximated merely by knowing the beginning and end of the growing season, absorbed photosynthetically active radiation, foliage nitrogen concentration, and vegetation type. © 1995.",,"biogeochemical control; biomass; biophysical control; climate system model; land/atmosphere interaction","National Science Foundation, NSF","This manuscript evolved from a presentation given at the ISLSCP-Americas Workshop, Columbia, MD, 23 June 1992, a CGD-CMAP seminar given at NCAR, 13 July 1992, and a seminar at the Department of Atmospheric Sciences, CSU, Fort Collins, CO, 24 September 1992.

The carbon budget of the terrestrial biosphere has attracted special attention because of its role in atmospheric changes in carbon dioxide. The terrestrial biosphere influences atmospheric CO2 through three main modes: First, large, nearly balanced fluxes of CO2 in photosynthesis and respiration exhibit a degree of interannual variability which can influence atmospheric CO2, at least on annual to decadal time scales. Second, land use changes release C02 to the atmosphere. Third, poorly understood processes are likely resulting in enhanced uptake of CO2 in certain ecosystems, acting as a sink in the global carbon cycle. This sink may result from forest demographics, atmospheric N deposition, or direct CO2 fertilization, or some synergistic combination of those processes. Global estimates of terrestrial carbon cycle components requires the use of remote observations; however, the appropriate remote sensing strategies are quite different for the various components. © 1995.",,"biogeochemical cycle; carbon budget; global estimate; nitrogen cycle; photosynthesis; remote sensing; terrestrial biosphere",,"Preparation of this review was supported by an Interdisciplinary Award from NASA's EOS program.

Research at the Bonanza Creek site continues on the mosaic of forests, shrublands, and wetlands in a wide variety of successional stages on the Tanana floodplain. This paper reviews research since 1988 into the capabilities of Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) for monitoring, classification, and characterization of these forests using radar remote sensing and modelling techniques. Classifications of successional stages, obtained by use of different classifiers on multi-frequency and multi-polarimetric AIRSAR data, are contrasted; these classifications have been used to predict classification accuracies obtained with ERS-1 data, and to estimate the utility of an ERS-1 and RADARSAT combination for classification. Forest classifications, used in combination with ground-truth data for more than 50 forest stands, are used to summarize the distribution of biomass on the landscape. This will allow projections of future biomass. Monitoring of forest phenology, seasonality of flooding, and freeze-thaw transitions is ongoing. Also, direct monitoring of dominant tree species is demonstrating diurnal variation and interrelationships among environmental, physiological, and backscatter measurements. © 1995, Cambridge University Press.

Microwave remote sensing is a potential means to accomplish this objective. However, to determine the optimum characteristics of a satellite synthetic aperture radar (SAR) for reliable forest monitoring it is first necessary to validate modelled microwave backscatter relationships in studies of relatively small areas using data from aircraft SAR systems and from detailed ground survey. The Maestro 1 Campaign provided fully polarimetric SAR data in three wavelengths together with a large set of ground data for Thetford Forest. Calibrated microwave responses were averaged for more than 300 stands, primarily of Corsican pine. A georeferenced database for the test site was built up from these mean responses combined with information on planting date, species and, for those stands fully sampled, characteristics such as height and timber volume. The radar backscatter at P and L bands, expecially the cross-polarized responses, correlate well with volume. An analysis is made of the accuracy with which regression models can be used to predict timber volume over larger areas around the test site. The precision of this prediction can be improved by fuller use of the information contained within the measured data, specifically in the correlation between the HH and VV returns, and by the fuller use of theoretical models, which consider more comprehensively the complete polarimetric backscatter mechanisms relevant to the response of stands. © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,"Corsican pine; forest monitoring; polarmetric SAR; timber volume; UK, England, Norfolk, Thetford Forest",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,01431161,,,,"English","Int.

The work was conducted at International Paper's Northern Experimental Forest (NEF) at Howland, Maine as part of NASA's Forest Ecosystem Dynamics (FED) project. An intensive soil survey was performed and relationships between soil properties (i.e., drainage class, depth of active zone, water holding capacity, carbon / nitrogen ratio, pH, and sum of bases), species composition, and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) from the Advanced Visible and Infrared Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS) were derived. Results showed that there was great variability in soil properties across the landscape due to complex regional glacial activity and recent alluvial events. Significant statistical differences were observed in species composition and NDVI between soil mapping units and with soil drainage class. However, other specific soil properties could not be used to explain these differences given the number of soil samples characterized, or without taking disturbance and management history into account.

In that context it is not only important to simulate effects of climatology (temperature, CO2) on forest evolution, but also to evaluate its NCE. For climatological conditions representative for the mid latitudes the influences of changes in atmospheric temperature and CO2 levels are simulated. Four compartments are defined in the model, two compartments simulating phytomass functional elements with large temporal biomass fluctuations (green compartment) and phytomass temporal fluctuations that are relatively small (non-green compartment). The litter compartment is also incorporated in the model and its fluxes evaluated. Model runs were executed for two CO2 scenarios and a climatological record reconstructed for the period covering 1833 till 1989 at a latitude and longitude of 51°N, 2.5°E. It has to be remarked that the addition of 4.5°C to a climatological record for all seasons is a simplification when simulating the effects of a temperature rise. The model outcome however suggests that the CO2 mixing ratio rate increase after World War II (WW II) has induced a phytomass increase in young forests.

Under dry soil conditions, the backscatter increased about 2-3 dB as the biomass increased from 0.05 kg/m2 to about 0.5-1.5 kg/m2, and the backscatter may be saturated near a 0.5-1.5 kg/m2 biomass level. The correlation coefficient between the backscatter and biomass was r2 = 0.46. When the Santa Barbara microwave canopy backscatter model was applied to simulate the ERS-1 SAR backscatter from the stands over dry ground, modeled and observed backscatter had similar trends with increasing biomass. For these stands, sensitivity analyses using the model showed that as the surface-soil moisture increased, the major contributor to the total backscatter was changed from canopy volume scattering to surface backscatter between 0.4 kg/m2 and about 1 kg/m2.

Our analyses are based upon four biophysical indices derived from the fully polarimetric SAR data: the volume scattering index (VSI), canopy structure index (CSI), biomass index (BMI), calculated from the backscatter magnitude data, and the interaction type index (ITI), calculated from the backscatter phase data. We developed a four-level landscape hierarchy based upon clustering analyses of the 12 index parameters (four indices each for P, L, and C band) from two test site images. Statistical analyses were used to examine the relative importance of the 12 parameters for discriminating ecosystem characteristics at various landscape scales. We found that ITI was the most important index (primarily C band = CITI) for level, vegetated terrain at all levels of the hierarchy. BMI was most important for differentiating between vegetated and nonvegetated areas and between sloping and level terrain. These findings indicate that upper canopy spatial characteristics and flooding in marshlands (reflected in the CITI) are more important than biomass in differentiating many tropical ecosystems with radar data. The relative importance of the indices varied with vegetation type; for example, PVSI was the most important for distinguishing between upland forests and regrowth, and PCSI was the most important for differentiating swamp forest types. Finally, we evaluated the potential of present and future spaceborne SARs for tropical ecosystem studies based on our results. Most of these SARs are single channel systems and will provide limited capability for characterizing biomass and structure of tropical vegetation. This is especially true for C band systems, which produce data similar to our CBMI parameter, which was one of the least important in our analyses. The SIR-C/X-SAR and proposed EOS SAR are future spaceborne multifrequency fully polarimetric SAR systems, and they will provide a significant contribution to tropical ecosystem studies. © 1994.",,"biomass index; biophysical indices; canopy structure; forest; forest ecosystem; radar remote sensing; remote sensing; wetland; Belize; Iti; Agriculture; Biomass; Ecology; Ecosystems; Electromagnetic wave backscattering; Environmental engineering; Forestry; Plants (botany); Remote sensing; Statistical methods; Synthetic aperture radar; Tropics; Backscatter magnitude data; Biophysical indices; Clustering analysis; Forest; Interaction type index; Landscape; Radar remote sensing; Vegetation; Wetland; Radar imaging","National Aeronautics and Space Administration, NASA: NAS7-918; Jet Propulsion Laboratory, JPL; California Institute of Technology, Caltech: 958533, 958732; California State University, CSU","This research was funded by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL), California Institute of Technology, under subcontracts 958732 to Geo Eco Arc Research and 958533 to California State University, Fresno as part of the NASA SIR-C / X-SAR program (Contract NAS7-918).

Current methods that employ the red (0.64 μm) and the near-IR (0.84 μm) regions are unsatisfactory in that the presence of aerosols in the scene distorts the apparent reflectance in the visible and near-IR ranges of the spectrum. The mid-IR spectral region is also sensitive to vegetation due to the absorption of liquid water in the foliage, but is not sensitive to the presence of most aerosols (except for dust). Therefore, mid-IR channels on the AVHRR and EOS-MODIS (e.g., the 3.75 μm or the 3.95 μm channels) have a unique potential for the remote sensing of dark, dense vegetation, particularly in the presence of biomass burning smoke or industrial/urban haze. The reflective part of the 3.75 μm channel (ρ3.75) is applied to images of the AVHRR over the eastern United States. This channel was found to be correlated to reflectance at 0.64 μm (ρ0.64), less sensitive to haze than the visible channel and superior to both the 0.64 μm reftectance and the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) to determine forest pixels in an image. However, its application to monitor the seasonal evolution of vegetation is presently questionable. For the purpose of the remote sensing of aerosol over dark, dense vegetation, it is proposed that the dark, dense vegetation be determined from ρ3.75 < 0.025. These findings may have further implications for other specific applications of the remote sensing of vegetation in hazy atmospheres. © 1994 IEEE.",,"Atmospheric aerosols; Biomass; Communication channels (information theory); Electromagnetic wave reflection; Forestry; Image processing; Infrared radiation; Radiometers; Satellites; Smoke; Spectrum analysis; Water absorption; Atmospheric correction; Normalized difference vegetation index; Reflectance; Vegetation; Remote sensing",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,01962892,,,,"English","IEEE Trans Geosci Remote Sens",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0028430333

Simulated pixels were parameterized with tree density and height for each tree (&gt; 3 cm dbh) covering a 200 m × 150 m area from an immature, conifer-dominated stand in the Northern Experimental Forest located near Howland, Maine. Airborne synthetic aperture radar (AIRSAR) imagery from the stand was used to evaluate the ability of the model to predict single pixel and textural patterns at 12.1 m resolution. Although the model was unable to accurately predict pixel-by-pixel responses, probably due to registration error, textural patterns from the HH polarized image were correlated to the simulated patterns. The model's assumption of randomly distributed stems within each pixel was another probable source of error as trees in this stand were aggregated at scales from 1 m to 50 m. Despite model inadequacies, significant pattern was found at all simulated backscatter resolutions for all polarizations for most quadrat sizes (&lt; 10,000 m2), but only for smaller quadrat sizes (&lt; 6,000 m2) for within-pixel structural properties (i.e., stem, branch, and leaf biomasses, stem density and average height).

Our results show that with principal component analysis of temporal data sets (winter and late summer) SAR images can be classified into general forest categories such as softwood, hardwood, regeneration, and clearing with better than 80% accuracy. Other nonforest classes such as bogs, wetlands, grass, and water were also accurately classified. Classifications from single date images suffered in accuracy. The winter image had significant confusion of softwoods and hardwoods with a strong tendency to overestimate hardwoods. Modeling results suggest that increased double-bounce scattering of the radar beam from conifer stands because of lowered dielectric constant of frozen needles and branches was the contributing factor for the misclassifications. © 1994.",,"Ecosystems; Forestry; Optical radar; Radar imaging; Remote sensing; Forest ecosystems; Global changes; Maine, USA; SAR images; Environmental engineering; ecosystem; forest; multifrequency imagery; polarimetric imagery; SAR images; temporal imagery; USA, Maine, Howland","National Aeronautics and Space Administration, NASA","Funding for this research was provided by NASA Headquarters Ecosystem Dynamics and Biogeochemical Cycles Branch and the SIR-C / XSAR Project.

Studies of the directional scattering of forest canopies have been limited in the past because of difficulties in suspending instruments over tall canopies or by being restricted to airborne scanning systems. In this article we discuss the use of the Advanced Solid-State Array Spectroradiometer (ASAS) to measure the bidirectional reflectance of several diverse forest canopies. ASAS data were acquired in 1989 and 1990 as part of an extensive field measurement campaign at International Paper's Northern Experimental Forest (NEF) located near Howland, Maine. Multiangle data sets were acquired for several sites under clear sky conditions and at view azimuths parallel, oblique, and perpendicular to the principal plane of the sun. The sensor radiance data for several surface types including forest stands and openings were converted to bidirectional reflectance using an atmospheric correction algorithm and optical thickness measurements. In addition, photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) hemispherical reflectance (albedo) was calculated from the corrected ASAS data and compared to a vegetation index. Highest observed reflectance factors were recorded in or near the solar principal plane at viewing geometries approaching the antisolar direction. Minimum reflectances were also observed in the solar principal plane, but in the forward scattered direction. Bidirectional reflectance factors (BRFs) acquired in the backscatter direction at visible wavelengths showed larger percent differences between viewing angles of 45° in the forward and backscattered direction (up to 95%) than near-IR data (up to 60%). The normalized vegetation index (NDVI) also varied with view angle but to a lesser degree than single-band BRFs. Also in contrast to single-band BRFs, maximum NDVI was recorded in the forward scattered direction and minimum NDVI was observed in the backscattered direction. Estimated fraction of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (FAPAR) was determined from the hemispherical PAR reflectance for several canopy types within the forest area. Examining the relationships with NDVI revealed a strong dependence of NDVI on FAPAR for nadir and 45° forward scattered data. A poor relationship was observed for data acquired at 45° in the backscattered direction and for NDVI derived from hemispherical reflectance. From these results, it is apparent that the sensor viewing geometry that minimizes the contribution of reflectance from branches and the ground will yield higher relationships between FAPAR and NDVI. © 1994.",,"ASAS; bidirectional reflectance; canopy; forest; spectroradiometer; USA, Maine, Howland; Forestry; Infrared imaging; Radiometry; Remote sensing; Forest canopy; Maine, USA; Radiation canopy; Vegetation reflectance; Environmental engineering","National Aeronautics and Space Administration, NASA","This study was supported by the Ecosystem Dynamics and Biogeochemical Cycles Branch at NASA Headquarters.

The first series of nine papers from the OTTER project is reported in this issue, Peterson and Waring present an overview of the project's objectives and organization, followed by analysis of ground-based measurements of environment and vegetational characteristics across the transect (Runyon et al). Against these ground-based measurements computer simulation models of ecosystem processes (Running) and climatic variation (Glassy and Running) are compared. Other papers assess the ability of optional sensors with different spectral and spatial resolution to discern variation in leaf area indices (Spanner et al.), light interception by different species (Law and Waring), and biochemical properties of the canopy (Matson et al.). Crown size, stocking density, and biomass are also evaluated with satellite-derived measures (Wu and Strahler). A way of estimating foliar biomass at maximum canopy leaf area from satellite imagery is presented and finally, the ability of present satellites to estimate macroscale ecosystem processes is evaluated. -from Editors",,"coniferous forest; ecosystem modelling; remote sensing; Oregon; USA; Carnivora",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,10510761,,,,"English",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0028315634

A plot of red pine trees in the University of Maine research forest was selected for the characterization and modeling. The purpose of this effort was to understand the cause of the high P-band returns. The red pine stand under study consisted of mature trees with an average height of 25 ms and diameters at breast height (DBH) of 28-38 cm. Soil moisture and soil bulk density measurements were made along with ground rough surface profiles. A tree was cut down in such a manner to keep its crown completely intact. Detailed biomass measurements of the needles, branches and trunks were also made. These site statistics have been used in a distorted Born approximation model of the forest stand. Computations indicate that the direct-reflected contributions from the ground are responsible for the high P-band HII observed returns. Tapered tree trunks have been used in the model to improve the accuracy of the direct-reflected calculation. The high P-band returns from red pine contrast with the results from previous studies of a hemlock forest in the area, which have lower P-band returns mainly due to backscattering from branches. © 1994.",,"P-band; pine; red pine; SAR; USA, Maine, Bangor; Ecosystems; Forestry; Remote sensing; Surveillance radar; Synthetic aperture radar; Forest ecosystems; Forest images; Forest structures; Maine, USA; Environmental engineering; Conium; Conium maculatum; Pinus resinosa","National Aeronautics and Space Administration, NASA: NAGW-2072, NAS5-30442","The authors would like to thank Nagi Khadr for his help in the collection of data from red pine trees.

Conventionally, forest biomass, along with quantities such as the leaf area index, drives the model. However, it is shown from the SAR data collected over the OTTER sites that the backscatter is not uniquely related to biomass. A sensitivity study is carried out using a scattering model to determine the variation of radar cross section as a function of several forest parameters. The results verify the above observation, and lead to the selection of suitable quantities to be recovered via radar experiments. Since this forest scattering model cannot be easily used for inversion of unknown parameters, the use of simplified models in forest parameter estimation schemes is suggested. © 1994.",,"Ecosystems; Forestry; Radar imaging; Remote sensing; Synthetic aperture radar; Forest canopy; Forest ecosystems; Oregon, USA; Environmental engineering; Carnivora; canopy; ecosystem model; forest; SAR; USA, Oregon",,,,,,,,,,,,"Moghaddam, M.; Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of TechnologyUnited States",,,00344257,,RSEEA,,"English","Remote Sens.

Canopy bidirectional reflectance data were acquired under clear, cloudless sky conditions over a large range of solar zenith angles. Pyranometer measurements of the total hemispherical upwelling and downwelling solar radiation above and below the forest canopy were simultaneously acquired. In addition, the PARABOLA instrument was deployed at different heights within the canopy, under overcast sky conditions, to measure the directional downward spectral radiation transmitted. The highly absorbing forest canopy, with a total plant area index of 3.9, reflected only ∼ 2.5% of the red (0.662 μm) hemispherical irradiance. Reflectances for wavebands in the photosynthetically active radiation (0.4-0.7 μm), the near-infrared (NIR, 0.826 μm), and the shortwave infrared (SWIR, 1.658 μm) were approximately 3%, 26%, and 15%, respectively. The bidirectional spectral reflectance factors in the solar principal plane were highly anisotropic, while those in the plane perpendicular to the solar principal plane were much closer to Lambertian. The forwardscatter was not much greater than the nadir reflectance, differing from the usual dense vegetative cover cases previously examined, especially for the NIR waveband. The hot spot maximum reflectance, occurring at the retrosolar view angle, was pronounced in all three wavebands. This prominent hot spot effect has not been observed for the NIR in other vegetation canopy types (e.g., grasslands, agricultural crops, and semiarid and desert scrub). View angle effects were more prominent than solar zenith angle effects, except at large solar zenith angles. Hemispherical spectral reflectance factors and albedo increased with increases in solar zenith angle. Substantial variation was observed in the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) for different view and solar zenith angles with a nominal value of 0.75. © 1994.",,"Ecosystems; Forestry; Infrared imaging; Remote sensing; Forest canopy; Global biomass; Terrestrial vegetation; Vegetation index; Environmental engineering; Conium; Conium maculatum; Picea; anisotropy; forest canopy; hemlock; radiometer; spruce","National Aeronautics and Space Administration, NASA","Funding for this research was provided through the Remote Sensing Science and Ecosystem Dynamics and Biogeochemical Processes programs within Code SEP at NASA Headquarters, Washington, DC.

A data and simulation system, RHESSys (Regional HydroEcological Simulation System), combines a set of remote sensing/GIS techniques with integrated hydrological and ecological models in order to automate the parameterization and simulation of a suite of ecological and hydrological flux and storage processes through the watershed. Specifically, we simulate forest canopy net photosynthesis (PSN) and total evapotranspiration (ET) through the year with a modeling package that integrates FORESTBGC, a stand level model of forest carbon, water and nitrogen budgets, with TOPMODEL, a quasi-distributed hydrological model. The latter model introduces the effects of hillslope hydrological processes, incorporating surface redistribution of soil water by saturated throughflow processes. The maintainance of regular patterns of soil water by throughflow processes cause forest ecosystem activity to vary dependent on hillslope position. The distributed framework is based on a terrain partition in which each terrain object (hillslopes and stream reaches) comprising the watershed are separately parameterized and simulated. The location of each terrain object within the watershed is explicitly represented while the internal variability of each object is represented as a joint parameter distribution. Generalization of the surface into different numbers of terrain objects (by growing or shrinking the extent of the stream network) is automatically accomplished using digital terrain data. This allows us to flexibly alter the spatial representation of the watershed by shifting surface information either into the internal hillslope parameter distributions or into greater numbers of hillslopes (and stream reaches). Limited simulations of a mountainous watershed in western Montana indicate that incorporation of within hillslope throughflow and the soil, topography and vegetation distribution has the effect of significantly altering the seasonal PSN and ET trends in comparison with lumped surface representations without lateral water flux. © 1993.",,"evapotranspiration; forest ecosystem; hillslope hydrology; hydroecological model; photosynthesis; soil water flow","National Aeronautics and Space Administration, NASA: NAGW-1234, NAGW-952","The work reported here was supported by NASA grants NAGW-1234 and NAGW-952.

It is of major economic importance to Quebec and similar northern regions, where it serves as the resource base of major industries such as timber, wildlife, and recreation. Because of its location, size, and ecology, the boreal forest is a high-risk area for the potential effects of global environmental changes. The object of the research project is to study the global transformations of the boreal forest ecosystem with regard to climate changes and to investigate synoptic remote sensing as a tool for quantifying bio-geophysical characteristics of the boreal forest biome. The analysis of the dynamics of its evolution is carried out using an ecological model (a “Gap” model such as the one proposed by Bonan, 1990) integrated into a geographic information system (GIS). The input parameters to the vegetation model consist of scenario simulations based on the general circulation model of the Canadian Climate Centre for doubled concentrations of atmospheric CO2. The parameters characterizing the surface are extracted from remote sensing data (soil cover, timber area, fire, and land cover characteristics). The bio-geophysical data, such as ecodistricts, soil landscapes, data from permanent sampling plots of the Government of Quebec (MFO), and topography, are also integrated in the GIS as digital maps. This paper presents a discussion on some critical aspects for integrating these multi-source data: geometric registration, point data interpolation for regional scaling, data reduction, remotely sensed inversion procedures, and database time integration.

In particular, we show, using a discrete scatterer model, that the dominant scattering mechanism may change drastically when the ground surface is tilted relative to the horizontal. In the case of a horizontal ground surface, for example, the total scattering may be dominated by scattering off the tree trunks, followed by a reflection off the ground surface. We show that for a relatively small tilt in the ground surface (about 2° from horizontal) the ground—trunk interaction term may be replaced by scattering from the branches alone as the dominant scattering mechanism.

Remote Sensing has probably omerged as one of the most viable techniques to assess and monitor habitat conditions. Comparative analysis of maps of two-time period can provide authentic data with respect to changes brought in the habitat conditions. Chandaka Wildlife Sanctuary, covering an area of 213.71 sq. km in Orissa is one of the natural reserves of elephants which has undergone serious changes brought in through anthropogenic activities of urban areas of Cuttack and Bhubaneshwar lying within the proximity of the sanctuary. The natural reserve, an ideal habitat for elephants, was connected to neighbouring extensive forest belts. These connections have been either degraded or deforested over the years. The present study analyses the types of habitat available in the sanctuary using remote sensing data (aerial and satellite). Vegetation-type maps of 1975 have been prepared from B/W aerial photographs of 1:25,000 scale. For assessing the current vegetation types, maps have been prepared from Indian Remote Sensing Satellite (LISS II) false colour composite on 1:50,000 scale. Comparative evaluation of the maps indicates changes in the vegetation pattern, increase in mining and agriculture areas within the sanctuary. Stratified field sampling of vegetation types provide structural characteristics of the vegetation. Bamboo has been found to extend in the valleys and side slopes of the sanctuary area during past 15 years. An analysis on response of vegetation in all major vegetation types mapped have been made in the context of the invasion of Eupatorium odoratum. Finally, bamboo biomass has been assessed through stratified random sampling as it constitutes a major elephant food source. © 1992 Springer.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Roy, P.S.; Indian Institute of Remote Sensing (NRSA), Dehradun, India",,,0255660X,,,,"English","J Indian Soc Remote Sens",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0011093207

Additive colour logic was used to interpret forest change (forest harvest and regeneration) across the landscape on the three dale NDVI colour composite. Harvest and regeneration area were quantified by applying a modified parallelepiped classification creating an RGB-NDVI image with 27 classes that were grouped into nine major forest change categories. Road construction, harvest and regeneration status on old clearcuts can be monitored by interpretation of the additive colour observed at any site.

Le RSQPA peut être mesuré par télédétection en utilisant l'indice de végétation par différence normalisée (NDVI). Nous avons utilisé un modèle de simulation d'écosystème, BLOME-BGC, que nous avons adapté pour des peuplements d'espèces du genre Picea (épinette) et du genre Populus (tremble) en vue de déterminer les variables importantes influant sur la valeur de ɛ en climat boréal. La photosynthèse annuelle et l'intensité respiratoire totale étaient plus élevées dans le cas du tremble, tandis que la PPN était supérieure dans le cas de l'épinette, aux deux sites. Les variables de peuplement, comme la biomasse des tiges et l'indice de surface foliaire, ont au des effets importants sur la valeur simulée de ɛ pour les deux genres, effets qui se sont traduits par une augmentation de l'intensité respiratoire et de la photosynthèse respectivement. Au contraire, les variables deforme de relief, comme la pente et l'orienttion, ont eu peu d'effet sur la valeur simulée de ɛ. La variation annuelle de la valeur simulée de ɛ a été corrélée avec la quantité de précipitation annuelle pour les deux genres à la lisière sud de la forêt boréale (Prince-Albert, Saskatchewan) ainsiq qu'à la lisière nord (Thompson, Manitoba). Pour une quantité donnée de précipitation, la valeur de ɛ pour l'épinette et le tremble était supérieure à Prince-Albert en raison d'une période de croissance plus longue (augmentation de la PPN). Ces simulations laissent croire qu'une valeur constante de ɛ ne peut pas être utilisée pour déterminer la PPN de forêts boréales à partir du RSQPA mesuré par télédétection. Net primary production (NPP, g m−2 year−1) may be calculated from the annual sum of daily absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (APAR, MJ m−2 day−1) multiplied by the dry matter yield of photosynthetically active radiation [ɛ, g/MJ, (often called radiation use efficiency)]. APAR may be remotely sensed using the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI). We used an ecosystem process simulation model, BLOME-BGC, parameterized for stands of Picea species (spruce) and Populus species (aspen), to determine the important variables affecting ɛ in boreal climates. Annual photosynthesis and total maintenance respiration were individually greater for aspen, whereas NPP was greater for spruce at both sites. Stand variables such as stem biomass and leaf area index had large effects on the simulated value of ɛ for both genera by increasing the amount of maintenance respiration and photosynthesis, respectively. In contrast, landscape variables such as slope and aspect had little effect on simulated ɛ. Year-to-year variation in simulated ɛ was correlated with annual precipitation for both genera at the southern edge of the boreal forest (Prince Albert, Saskatchewan) and at the northern edge (Thompson, Manitoba). For a given amount of precipitation, spruce and aspen had higher ɛ at Prince Albert due to a longer growing season (increasing NPP). These simulations suggest that a constant ɛ may not be used to determine NPP for the boreal forest from remotely sensed APAR. © 1992 Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.",,"Ecosystems - Mathematical Models; Remote Sensing - Environmental Applications; Absorbed Photosynthetically Active Radiation; Aspen; Ecosystem Process Simulation Model BIOME-BGC; Net Primary Production; Normalized Difference Vegetation Index; Spruce; Forestry",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,07038992,,,,"English","Can J Remote Sens",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0026892180

Grassland senescence is delayed over deeper, wetter soils that are likely debris flow source areas. Prediction of actual soil depths using vegetation indices may be possible up to some limiting depth greater than the grass rooting zone.

The model as input the geographic patterns of leaf area index (lai), available soil water capacity (swc) and microclimatic parameters over the landscape. These patterns are represented with the use of a template consisting of the set of hillslopes, stream channels and subwatersheds that completely define the landscape. A geo-referenced database containing digital elevation data, remotely sensed information and other environmental data are stratified by this template. We have found that the stratification of the surface data sets by a hillslope or watershed template produces landscape units with low internal variance of the important model parameters but high between unit variance. By producing templates at different levels of resolution, we have the ability to reorganize the model parameter set to different levels of surface generalization. The model is directly parameterized for each of these surface units which can then be simulated in parallel, providing the ability to expand the simulation to large regions. © 1991.",,"evapotranspiration; forest; forest ecosystem; geographic information system; leaf area index; microclimate parameter; primary productivity; remote sensing; watershed","National Aeronautics and Space Administration, NASA: 677-21-31-01, NAGW-1234","This research was funded by NASA Grants NAGW-1234, and Grant 677-21-31-01.",,,,,,,,,,"Band, L.E.; Department of Geography, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ont.

A NASA/JPL multiple-view angle, multiple-frequency SAR was flown aboard a DC-8 aircraft on September 2, 1989. The extensive measurements of ground truth and canopy geometry parameters were performed in a 200 m-square hemlock-dominated plot inside the forest. About 10% of the trees were sampled to determine a distribution of diameter at breast height (DBH). Four representative hemlock trees with a DBH equal to 6, 12, 21.9, and 30.2 cm were destructively sampled to obtain the tree architectural and biomass data of the forest. Hemlock trees in the forest are modeled by characterizing tree trunks, branches, and needles (leaves) with randomly oriented, lossy dielectric cylinders whose area and orientation distributions are prescribed. The distorted Born approximation is used to compute the backscatter at P-, L-, and C-SAR frequencies. The input parameters to the model are determined from the analysis of ground truth and tree architectural data gathered from the experiment site.

The primary approach to establishing monthly LAI included annual destructive analyses and monthly measurements of needle fall and elongation. Imagery from the Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) and patterns of light penetration were also used in attempts to derive less arduous estimates; the TM imagery was most promising. LAIs ranged from 3.0 to 6.5 on control plots over the 3 yr, with repeated fertilization increasing maximum LAI by >40%. Seasonal variation was high (40%), as was variation from year to year. An average of 31% of the incident photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) penetrated the canopies annually, ranging from 18 to 42% seasonally. Seasonal light penetration could not be described using a simple application of the Beer-Lambert law, perhaps due to the highly aggregated nature of the canopies. Models incorporating more information on canopy structure are necessary to predict light penetration through slash pine stands accurately. A model of needle litterfall was derived that could account for much of the seasonal and annual variation using stand basal area and climate conditions from the spring of the previous year; this model may be useful for developing climate-driven predictions of LAI. Efficiencies of use of incoming and intercepted PAR were low compared to other forest types. Low light interception and high nutrient-use efficiencies (demonstrated in earlier studies) are important adaptive characteristics of slash pine stands to these relatively warm and nutrient-poor sites.","Biomass; Canopy structure; Florida; Leaf area index (LAI); Light interception; Litterfall; Needle elongation; Photosynthetically active radiation (PAR); Pinus elliottii; Remote sensing; Seasonal change; Slash pine","canopy structure; leaf area index; light; pine; slash pine; USA, Florida",,,,,,,,,,,,"Gholz, H.L.; Department of Forestry, , Gainesville, FL 32611, United States",,"Ecological Society of America",00129615,,ECMOA,,"English","Ecol.

Monthly maximum value composites of AVHRR normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) [(near infrared - visible)/(near infrared + visible)] were calculated for 19 coniferous forest stands in Oregon, Washington, Montana, and California. The leaf area index (LAI) of the conifer forests explained 70% and 79% of the variation of the summer maximum AVHRR NDVI in July 1986 and July 1987, respectively. The seasonal variation of NDVI was related to phenological changes in LAI, as well as the proportion of surface cover types contributing to the overall reflectance. The varying solar zenith angles in the summer and winter months complicated analyses of the seasonal differences in LAI of the forest stands by reducing NDVI values in the winter months. It is concluded that AVHRR NDVI data from July were related to the seasonal maximum leaf area index of coniferous forests of the western United States, and that seasonal differences in the AVHRR NDVI were related to: a) phenological changes in LAI caused by climate, b) the proportions of surface cover types contributing to the overall reflectance, and c) large variations in the solar zenith angle. © 1990.",,"Biomass - Remote Sensing; Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR); Coniferous Forests; Leaf Area Index (LAI); Temperate Coniferous Forests; Forestry; AVHRR; coniferous forest; leaf area index; NDVI; solar zenith angle; surface cover type; USA","NCA2-138; University of Montana, UM","The authors gratefully acknowledge the efforts of Kurt Teuber, Scott McLeod, and Chris Hathaway of the School of Forestry at the University of Montana for their assistance in the collection of the field data, and Ernest Daghir of the NOAA National Weather Service Field Station in Redwood City, Californiaf or assistance in the acquisition of the AVHRR data used in this study.

The relationships between TR and the Normalized Difference (ND) index of vegetation for agricultural land use were different from those for forests. At the same TR, the forests had lower near infrared reflectance. This caused the ND of forests to fall below the TR/ND relationships formed by agricultural land use. This difference between forest and agricultural land use did not exist when visible reflectance (VIS) was used as the index of vegetation. When the two land use systems were combined VIS accounted for about 86 per cent of the variance in TR. The slope of the relationships between VIS and TR differed for TM and AVHRR scenes. This was explained by differences in the TR and VIS reflectance of surfaces with near-zero evaporation.

The visible (VIS) and near infrared (NIR) reflectances and their combination, the Normalized Difference (ND) Vegetation Index were calculated from the AVHRR sensor. From the SMMR, the microwave Polarization Difference (PD) was calculated as the difference between the vertically and horizontally polarized brightness temperatures at 37 GHz. The AVHRR data were gridded to match the 25 km spatial resolution of the SMMR 37 GHz data and both data sets were analysed to provide a temporal resolution of one month. Using a one month lag, the ND, PD, VIS and NIR, indices were plotted against rainfall and water balance estimates of evaporation, calculated using the monthly rainfall data and long term averages of pan evaporation from 74 locations covering a range of vegetation types. The monthly plots had wide scatter. This scatter was reduced markedly by aggregating the data over twelve months, leading to the conclusion that direct satellite monitoring of annual evaporation across the Australian continent using PD or VIS is feasible for areas with evaporation less than 600 mm y-1. The ND relationship was limited by scatter and the PD and VIS relationships by their saturation above 600 mm y-1, which spanned about two-thirds of the continental range studied. Scatter was reduced and ND had a predictive range above 600 mmy-1 if evaporation was normalized by evaporative demand. But prior knowledge of potential evaporation is needed in this approach. The NIR reflectance of forests were consistently lower than neighbouring areas of agriculture, thus ND may underpredict the evaporation of forests relative to agriculture. Temporal resolution of the satellite indices over periods of one month could not be evaluated due to spatial and temporal variability of climatic and biological factors not accounted for in the water balance estimates of evaporation. © 1990 Taylor &amp; Francis Ltd.",,"agriculture; AVHRR; forest; land surface evaporation; SMMR; vegetation index; Australia; Biomass - Remote Sensing; Radiometers; Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR); Global Biosphere; Land Surface Evaporation; Microwave Polarization Difference; Remote Sensing","National Aeronautics and Space Administration, NASA; Nebraska Academy of Sciences, NAS; National Research Council, NRC","Acknowledgments R.

Understanding the effects of air pollutants on natural ecosystems and predicting the possible consequences of various levels of exposure is of major biological concern. The area in the vicinity of the Sulphite pulp mill at Port Alice, British Columbia provides an ideal setting for the examination of the effects of SO2 on coniferous forests. Gaseous sulfur dioxide, when taken up by the needles, results in the formation of bisulfite, a highly toxic compound that effects the functioning of the cell wall and other cellular membranes. The forests in the immediate vicinity of the mill show symptoms of chronic exposure, including chlorosis, a reduction in photosynthetic biomass, mortality, and a decrease in species diversity. While the effects of SO2 exposure on individual trees are readily apparent in the immediate vicinity of the mill, the effect on the surrounding forests is difficult to quantify using conventional forest inventory methods. Reflectance spectra and chlorophyll a and b measurements were made a five sites (composed predominantly of western hemlock) along the SO2 exposure gradient. Trends in the reflectance spectra that are attributable to a decreased chlorophyll content and an increase in chloroplast damage at those sites nearer to the pulp mill were observed.",,"Air Pollution; Biomass; Remote Sensing; Spectrum Analysis; Sulfur Dioxide; Abstract Only; Coniferous Forests; Forest Damage; Reflectance Spectra; Sulfur Dioxide Exposure Gradient; Forestry",,,,,,,,,,,,"Curtiss, Brian; Univ of Colorado, Cent for Study of, ",,,,,IGRSE,,"English","Dig Int Geosci Remote Sens Symp (IGARSS)",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0024919258

These sites had a range in leaf area index of 0.6 to 16 m2 m-2 and net primary productivity of 0.3 to 14 Mg ha-1 yr-1. Measurements of soil and forest floor inorganic N concentrations and in situ net N mineralization, nitrification, denitrification, and soil respiration were made monthly for one year. Microbial biomass C and anaerobic N mineralization, an index of N availability, were also measured. Annual mean concentrations of NH4+ ranged from 37 to 96 mg N kg-1 in the forest floor and from 1.7 to 10.7 mg N kg-1 in the mineral soil. Concentrations of NO3- were low ( &lt; 1 mg N kg-1) at all sites. Net N mineralization and nitrification, as measured by the buried bag technique, were low on most sites and denitrification was not detected at any site. Available N varied from 17 to 101 mg N kg-1, microbial biomass C ranged from 190 to 1230 mg Ckg-1, and soil respiration rates varied from 1.3 to 49 mg C kg-1 day-1 across these sites. Seasonal peaks in NH4+ concentrations and soil respiration rates were usually observed in the spring and fall. The soils data were positively correlated with several aboveground variables, including leaf area index and net primary productivity, and the near infrared-to-red reflectance ratio obtained from the airborne simulator of the Thematic Mapper satellite. The data suggest that close relationships between aboveground productivity and soil microbial processes exist in forests approaching semi-equilibrium conditions. © 1989 Kluwer Academic Publishers.","forest soils; leaf area index; microbial biomass; net primary productivity; nitrogen availability; nitrogen cycling; remote sensing; soil respiration","biomass; conifer; conifer forest; forest; forest soil; leaf area index; microbial; microbial properties; net primary productivity; nitrogen cycling; soil; stand characteristics; USA, Oregon",,,,,,,,,,,,"Myrold, D.D.; Department of Soil Science, , Corvallis, 97331, OR, United States",,"Kluwer Academic Publishers",01682563,,BIOGE,,"English","Biogeochemistry",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0024784909

Studies have shown that sensor view angle, canopy structure, and percentage of canopy coverage can affect the response of a thermal sensor. These studies have been primarily of agricultural regions and there have been relatively few examples describing the thermal characteristics of forested regions. This paper describes an extension of an existing thermal vegetation canopy radiance model which has been modified to partially account for the geometrically rough structure of a forest canopy. Fourier series expansion of a canopy height profile is used to calculate improved view factors which partially account for the directional variations in canopy thermal radiance transfers. The original and updated radiance model predictions are compared with experimental data obtained over a deciduous (oak-hickory) forest site. The experimental observations are also used to document azimuthal and nadir directional radiance variations. Maximum angular variations in measured canopy temperatures were 4-6°C (azimuth) and 2.5°C (nadir). Maximum angular variations in simulated temperatures using the modified rough surface model was 4°C. The rough surface model appeared to be sensitive to large gaps in the canopy height profile, which influenced the resultant predicted temperature. © 1989.",,"Biomass--Remote Sensing; Directional Thermal Radiance; Forest Canopy; Thermal Vegetation Canopy; Forestry; canopy height; directional thermal radiance; forest canopy",,"The research reported here was sponsored by a U.S. Army Corps of Engineers Waterways Experiment Station contract between E.G.&G.

Two logarithmic equations were tested in conjunction with six laser canopy measurements to determine which model best described variation in the ground measurements. The best models explained between 53% and 65% of the variability noted in ground measurements of forest biomass (green weight) and volume. Biomass and volume estimates derived using laser data were very variable when compared with the corresponding ground measurements site by site.

Spectral absorption features characteristic of proteins (containing nitrogen), lignin and other leaf constituents occur throughout the shortwave infrared region (1200-2400 nm). The lignin and nitrogen concentration of dried and ground deciduous leaves have been predicted from reflectance spectra obtained in the laboratory. The optimum wavelengths for prediction were selected using stepwise multiple linear regression. The prediction errors were comparable to chemical techniques. Analysis of the reflectance spectra of fresh, whole leaves has been limited thus far to conifer leaves but indicate spectral features predictive of nitrogen and lignin also found in airborne spectra. Airborne Imaging Spectrometer (AIS) were evaluated for whole forest canopy physical and chemical properties. Variations in spectral brightness were associated with variations in total water content of the foliar biomass. Comparison of forest spectra with spectrally flat targets revealed absorption features common to the canopy spectra between 1500 and 1700 nm which were tentatively attributed to absorption by lignin and starch.

Proper forest exploitation is a crucial part of the solution of such important problems as the rational use of land and water resources, stable crop yields, and the creation of favourable conditions for human life. To solve these important economic problems, the Siberian branch of the USSR Academy of Sciences has devised a long-term programme of ecological monitoring of Siberian forest resources using aerospace techniques. The programme provides for the establishment and improvement of ecogeographical and physicotechnological principles of the remote sensing of forests and the development of fundamental forest-biological research based on new methodologies, the results of which are used to solve urgent forestry and nature protection problems.

Major significant changes in spectral reflectance as shown by t-value maxima are observed in the visible, but not in the near infrared region. The related cellular changes are hypertrophy of chloroplasts, reduction of chloroplast number, and formation of large isodiametrical hypodermal cells.

Remote and in situ measurements of O3 and aerosols were made from a NASA Electra aircraft on several long-range flights spanning different areas between Tabatinga and Belem, Brazil. Continuous O3 distributions were obtained between the aircraft altitude and the ground with an airborne differential absorption lidar (DIAL) system. Aerosol distributions were also continuously measured above and below the aircraft with the DIAL system. In situ O3 measurements were made on the aircraft and from ground-launched ozonesondes at Manaus and Natal. Large-scale variations in the vertical and horizontal distributions of O3 and aerosols were observed on nearly all flights over the Amazon Basin, with O3 exceeding 50 parts per billion by volume (ppbv) in some regions. Both positive and negative correlations were observed between O3 mixing ratios and aerosol concentrations. In nearly all cases, when O3 and aerosols were negatively correlated, this represented clean midtropospheric air, and when they were positively correlated, the air mass had undergone photochemical O3 production as a result of biomass burning. A 59% increase in the planetary boundary layer (PBL) O3 level was observed between the initial Manaus-Belem flights on July 23-24, 1985 and the later flights on August 8-9, 1985. This was attributed to the increase in biomass burning near the Rio Amazonas and its tributaries and in savannah regions south of the Amazon Basin. Flights to the west of Manaus measured enhanced O3 and aerosol levels near the Rio Solimoes, while the area sampled upwind of the river exhibited lower O3 levels. This was explained by the increased incidence of biomass burning near the river. This paper also examines the variability of the trade wind inversion (TWI) height across the Amazon Basin and the influence of O3 levels above the TWI on the budget of O3 in the PBL. Measurements reported for the early dry season characterize the background distribution of O3 and aerosols in the PBI prior to the onset of extensive biomass burning. These data provide the basis for a basin-scale estimate of photochemical O3 production from biomass-burning emissions.",,"ozone; aerosol; air analysis; Brazil",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,JGREA,,"English","J.

We used a truck-mounted scatterometer for field tests on a 1.5-3.0 m pygmy forest of cypress (Cupressus pygmaea) and pine (Pinus contorta ssp. Bolanderi) near Mendocino, CA. We quantified 31 structural variables of the forest at seven sites. We also measured backscatter from a life-sized physical model of the pygmy forest, composed of nine wooden trees with ""leafy branches"" of sponge-wrapped dowels. This model enabled independent testing of the effects of stem, branch, and leafy branch biomass, branch angle, and moisture content on radar backscatter. Field results suggested that surface area of leaves played a greater role in leaf scattering properties than leaf biomass per se. Tree leaf area index was strongly correlated with vertically polarized power backscatter (r = 0.94; P < 0.01). Field results suggested that the scattering role of leaf water is enhanced as leaf surface area per unit leaf mass increases, i.e., as the moist scattering surfaces become more dispersed. Fog condensate caused a measurable rise in forest backscatter, both from surface and internal rises in water content. Tree branch mass per unit area was highly correlated with crosspolarized backscatter in the field (r = 0.93; P < 0.01), a result also seen in the physical model. Emergent trees had the predominant effect on radar backscatter in the field, with understory shrubs playing an insignificant role, even in these open-canopied forests. In the physical model, the presence of wet stems and wet leafy branches and the angle of branches affected backscatter most, with lesser contributions by dry stems and branches and changes in branch thickness respectively. © 1987.",,"BIOMASS - Remote Sensing; RADAR IMAGING - Applications; C-BAND MULTIPOLARIZATION RADAR; DETECTING FOREST STRUCTURE; RADAR BACKSCATTER; FORESTRY; California; Cupressus pygmaea; cypress; Mendocino; pine; Pinus contorta bolanderi","National Aeronautics and Space Administration, NASA","leaf area index and of total forest mass, BaskervilleG, .

The study examined seasonal variations, interpretation procedures and vegetation composition/distribution and their effect on overall classification accuracy and ability to identify individual pine species. Photographic images were used for visual interpretations while digital analysis was performed using a common (ERDAS) microcomputer image processing system. The classification schemes were evaluated using contingency tables and were ranked using the KAPPA statistic. The various classification schemes were ranked differentially according to study site location. Visual interpretation procedures ranked best, or least accurate, depending on the spatial distribution and complexity of the forest cover. Supervised classification techniques were more accurate than unsupervised clustering over all sites and seasons. Maximum likelihood classification of June data was superior to any digital classification technique of February data.

Here we present two approaches to investigate the role of boreal forests in the global carbon cycle. First, a tracer transport model wihich incorporates the normalized-difference vegetation index (NDVI) obtained from advanced very high resolution radiometer (AVHRR) radiances was used to simulate the annual cycle of CO2 in the atmosphere. Results indicate that the seasonal growth of the combined boreal forests of North America and Eurasia accounts for about 50% of the mean seasonal CO2 amplitude recorded at Pt Barrow, Alaska (71° N, 157° W) and about 30% of the more globally representative CO2 signal at Mauna Loa, Hawaii (20° N, 156° W). Second, tree-ring width data from four boreal treeline sites in northern Canada were positively correlated with Pt Barrow CO2 drawdown (that is, maximum-minimum CO2 concentration) for the period 1971-1982. These results suggest that large-scale changes in the growth of boreal forests may be contributing to the observed increasing trend in CO2 amplitude. They further suggest that tree-ring data may be applicable as indices for CO2 uptake and remote sensing estimates of photosynthetic activity. © 1987 Nature Publishing Group.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"D'Arrigo, R.; Tree-Ring Laboratory, , Palisades, NY 10964, United States",,,00280836,,,,"English",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0023477052

Three channels of ratioed data (VV/ HH, VH/HH, and VH/VV) are generated from the HH, VV, and VH polarization data (V = vertical, H = horizontal). The ratioed data are linearly stretched to yield a digital number within a range of 0 to 255. The techniques for reducing SAR speckle noise and for measuring the degree of separation are discussed. For surface feature delineation, the results indicate that cross polarization as well as cross polarization ratioed data better delineate those surface features that are difficult to separate by like polarization data. The results suggest using a median value filtering technique to reduce within-plot data fluctuation to increase the separability measure. For forest vegetation characterization, the results indicate that multipolarization SAR data may be used to estimate forest properties such as total-tree biomass, basal area, and tree height.

Space-based remote sensing may enable the production of accurate world forest maps needed to examine this concern objectively. To test the limits of remote sensing for large-area forest mapping, we use LANDSAT data acquired over a site in the forested mountains of southern California to examine the relative capacities of a variety of popular image processing algorithms to discriminate different forest types. Results indicate that certain algorithms are best suited to forest classification. Differences in performance between the algorithms tested appear related to variations in their sensitivities to spectral variations caused by background reflectance, differential illumination, and spatial pattern by species.

The key role of vegetation in this cycle is clearly demonstrated by the semi-annual variations of the carbon dioxide concentration in a given hemisphere. The primary variables of interest are the net primary productivity and the biomass on a global scale and the key to their estimation is the leaf-area index (LAI). A global determination of the LAI is practical only with remote-sensing satellite systems. A hierarchical approach to obtaining a LAI map of deciduous boreal forests, which contain a significant part of the total global carbon reservoir using satellite data is presented. The results show that it is very important to understand the nature of the basic physical interaction of solar radiation with canopy biophysical characteristics, if meaningful estimates of these variables are to be made.

If this vital resource is to be monitored using high resolution satellite and airborne sensors, topographic information must be incorporated into image analysis procedures. For the past three years, research has been going on at the Canada Centre for Remote Sensing into the integration of digital terrain models with imagery for the purposes of estimating timber volume and biomass energy. This paper describes the principal components of our processing scheme with particular emphasis on the use of elevation, slope and aspect data. Imagery is first rectified to a map grid with the aid of a digital elevation model (DEM) (Guindon et al, 1980). Corrected imagery is desirable as both topographic and auxiliary information are map-based. The DEM and sensor flight path parameters can also be used to generate masks which accurately delineate areas of shadow and layover. Such areas can be extensive on both airborne and satellite SAR imagery and must be excluded from further analysis. Terrain data have been incorporated in the image classification process in two ways. Elevation, slope and aspect have been found to be useful features in forest species discrimination and have, therefore, been treated as additional features in maximum likelihood classification. Masks have been used to improve class statistics by eliminating corrupted pixels, such as shadow and SAR layover pixels, and to limit image areas over which classification is carried out, The timber volume for an area covered by imagery can be estimated with the aid of the classified image if the average timber volume per unit ground surface area is known for each class. In mountainous areas, problems can arise because the twodimensional image projection of the terrain does not accurately reflect the total extent of the ground surface. This can be overcome by applying a pixel by pixel correction factor based on surface slope information. © 1982 Canadian Space Agency.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,07038992,,,,"English","Can J Remote Sens",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-0020409219
